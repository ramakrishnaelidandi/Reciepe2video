  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium bowl, whisk together the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract, stirring until smooth. Refrigerate. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, mash the bananas with a fork. </step>
    <step num="3">Add in the flour, sugar, baking powder, oil, egg, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla. Stir until just combined, without over mixing. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour half of the banana bread batter into a greased bundt pan. </step>
    <step num="5">With an ice cream scoop, scoop the cream cheese mixture evenly onto the cake batter, making sure that it does not touch the sides of the cake pan. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour the rest of the banana bread batter on top and smooth it evenly. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 30 minutes, or until the banana bread is golden. </step>
    <step num="8">To make the caramel glaze, heat the sugar in a saucepan over medium-high heat. </step>
    <step num="9">Once the sugar begins to melt, stir with a wooden spoon or whisk. </step>
    <step num="10">Once the sugar reaches a boil, add the butter and stir until melted. </step>
    <step num="11">Remove from heat, add in the heavy cream and immediately stir until incorporated. </step>
    <step num="12">Allow the caramel to cool and thicken. </step>
    <step num="13">Invert the banana bread onto a wire rack set on top of a baking tray. </step>
    <step num="14">Pour the caramel glaze over the cake, letting the excess drip off the wire rack and onto the baking tray. </step>
    <step num="15">Once the glaze has set, slice the cake. </step>
