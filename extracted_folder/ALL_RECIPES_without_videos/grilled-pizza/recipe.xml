  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat grill over high heat for 5-10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Coat pizza dough with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Using your hands, rub oil onto outside of dough while carefully stretching it into a circle 12-14 inches (30-35 cm) in diameter. </step>
    <step num="2">Place oiled pizza dough onto preheated grill and quickly brush the top with an additional tablespoon of olive oil. Close grill and allow pizza dough to cook for 3-4 minutes over high heat. </step>
    <step num="3">After 4 minutes, check on the pizza. The dough should start to form large bubbles across the top. Using a large spatula or set of tongs, flip the dough over. Lower the heat to low and add the toppings to the pizza. </step>
    <step num="4">Increase the heat back to high and close the grill. </step>
    <step num="5">Cook pizza for 5-6 minutes, until cheese has melted and the bottom of the crust is lightly charred. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
