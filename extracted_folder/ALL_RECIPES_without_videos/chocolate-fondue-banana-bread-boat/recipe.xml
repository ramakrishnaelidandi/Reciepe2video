  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, mash the bananas with a fork. </step>
    <step num="2">Add in the oil, egg, sugar, and vanilla. Stir until combined. </step>
    <step num="3">Add in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Stir until just combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour the banana bread batter into a greased loaf pan. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. </step>
    <step num="6">In a small saucepan, combine the cream milk and chocolate, and melt over low heat. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the vanilla and stir to combine. Remove from heat, and cover with a lid. </step>
