  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a medium pan, add oil and garlic and cook until garlic is lightly browned. Add tofu by pulling pieces off to produce the full “scramble” effect. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the turmeric, paprika, red pepper flakes, and nutritional yeast and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the vegetable stock and cook until absorbed in the tofu. </step>
    <step num="3">Drizzle with hot sauce if you desire. </step>
    <step num="4">Spoon some of the scramble in the center of a tortilla and add any fillings you would like. </step>
    <step num="5">NOTE: Leave plenty of room on the ends otherwise food will spill out once it's folded up. </step>
    <step num="6">Fold the left and right sides of the tortilla in toward the center, then roll the bottom (the end nearest you) up towards the top. </step>
    <step num="7">Dampen a paper towel and wrap it around the burrito, mimicking the fold of the burrito itself. Do the same with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="8">Place your burritos in a plastic bag and freeze until breakfast. </step>
    <step num="9">NOTE: Save for up to 1 month. </step>
    <step num="10">When you are ready to eat, take one of the burritos out, remove parchment paper and microwave burrito (still in paper towel) in the microwave for 3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="11">Allow to cool for 1 minute. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
