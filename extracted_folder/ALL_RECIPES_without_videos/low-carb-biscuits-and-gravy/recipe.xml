  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">Make the biscuits: In a medium bowl, add the almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">In a separate large bowl, add the Greek yogurt, eggs, and honey. Whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="3">Sift the dry ingredients through a fine-mesh sieve into the wet ingredients. Mix to combine until fluffy. Do not overmix. </step>
    <step num="4">Using a large ice cream scoop or a large spoon, scoop dough onto the lined baking sheet, spacing evenly. You should have about 6 biscuits. (If the oven is not ready, keep biscuits in the refrigerator so that they do not spread out and flatten.) </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="6">Make the gravy: Drizzle a bit of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, then add the sausage and cook 7-10 minutes, or until browned. </step>
    <step num="7">Reduce the heat to medium-low and add ¼ cup (25 g) of almond flour, the cayenne, paprika, rosemary, sage, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine, then add the milk. </step>
    <step num="8">Simmer the gravy until it reaches your desired consistency, stirring occasionally. You can add up to ¼ cup (25 g) more almond flour for a thicker, heartier gravy. </step>
    <step num="9">Serve the gravy hot, poured over a warm biscuit. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
