    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="1">With a mandolin or a sharp knife, carefully cut the sweet potatoes into ¹⁄₁₆-inch (1 mm) thick slices. </step>
    <step num="2">Place the sweet potato slices in a large bowl, add the salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder, and toss the potatoes until evenly coated. </step>
    <step num="3">Let sit for about 20 minutes, until water releases from the sweet potatoes and the slices are soft and flexible. </step>
    <step num="4">Brush the cups of a 12-cup muffin tin with the olive oil. </step>
    <step num="5">Arrange 5 sweet potato slices around the sides of a muffin cup, overlapping slightly. Place 1 slice on the bottom to create a flower. Repeat with the remaining potato slices. Sprinkle a bit of cheese in the bottom of each cup. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 10 minutes until the cheese has melted and the sweet potato slices are tender. </step>
    <step num="7">Remove the potato cups from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 300°F (150°C). </step>
