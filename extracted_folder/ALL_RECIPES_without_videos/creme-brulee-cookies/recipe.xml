  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large, microwave-safe bowl, whisk the yolks and ½ cup (100 g) of sugar until pale in color. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the cornstarch and vanilla extract, and whisk well. Add the milk and whisk until fully combined. </step>
    <step num="3">Loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 4-6 minutes, whisking every 1-2 minutes, until the mixture becomes a thick custard. </step>
    <step num="4">Re-cover with plastic wrap and chill for about 2 hours. </step>
    <step num="5">In a medium bowl, cream the softened butter and ½ cup (100 g) of sugar with a hand mixer until light and fluffy. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the egg, and mix until fully incorporated. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the flour and mix until the dough is crumbly, but holds together when squeezed. </step>
    <step num="8">Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Once chilled, roll out the dough between two layers of parchment paper until it is ¼-inch (6 mm) thick. </step>
    <step num="10">Cut out 6 2-inch (5 cm) diameter rounds of dough. Remove the excess dough and transfer the rings to a parchment-lined baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="11">Re-roll the leftover cookie dough to the ¼-inch (6 mm) thickness. Cut out 6 more 2-inch (5 cm) rounds, then cut a 1½-inch (4 cm) ring inside the 2-inch (5 cm) rounds. Transfer the whole rounds to the baking sheet, then remove the inner circles. </step>
    <step num="12">Bake the cookies for 10 minutes, until pale and just barely cooked. Let sit at room temperature to cool for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="13">Once the cookies are cool, transfer the chilled custard to a piping bag. Pipe the custard onto the circle-shaped cookies completely covering the surface. </step>
    <step num="14">Place the ring-shaped cookies on top of the custard-topped cookies and press down gently to adhere. </step>
    <step num="15">Add the remaining cup of sugar to a small pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar melts and begins to caramelize. Make sure there are no lumps of sugar. </step>
    <step num="16">While the caramel is still hot, pour about 2 tablespoons over each cookie to fill the ring on top. Let the cookies cool completely. </step>
    <step num="17">Enjoy! </step>
