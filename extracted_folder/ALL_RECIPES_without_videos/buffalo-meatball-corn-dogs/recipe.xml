  <steps>
    <step num="0">Meatballs: In a medium bowl, mix together ground chicken, bread crumbs, egg, blue cheese, salt, pepper, and Frank’s Red Hot until evenly combined. Be careful not to overmix. Roll into golf-size balls. </step>
    <step num="1">Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add meatballs and cook until brown on all sides, about 3–4 minutes per side. Remove meatballs from the pan (they will not be fully cooked at this time). </step>
    <step num="2">Batter: Whisk together cornmeal, flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder. Add in egg and milk, then whisk until a smooth batter forms. </step>
    <step num="3">Heat 3 inches of vegetable oil in a pot until temperature is 350ºF (175ºC). </step>
    <step num="4">Place the meatballs on skewers, lollipop-style. Holding onto the skewer, dip the meatball into the batter. Use a spoon to help fully coat each meatball in batter. </step>
    <step num="5">Lower the meatballs into the oil and cook for 3–4 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through and the outsides are a deep golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve with more Frank’s and ranch dressing for dipping. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
