  <steps>
    <step num="0">To make the Berbere Braised Lamb, heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over medium-high heat until oil is lightly shimmering. Add the lamb to the pot, season with salt and pepper, and brown on all sides, for about 10 minutes. Remove the lamb from the pot. </step>
    <step num="1">To the same pot, add the red onions and cook until brown, for about 15-20 minutes. Stir in the ghee, garlic, ginger, paprika, cayenne, fenugreek, nutmeg, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, allspice, and tomato paste. </step>
    <step num="2">Pour in the beef stock, stirring well to incorporate. Bring the sauce to a boil and return the lamb to the pot. Reduce heat to medium-low, so the sauce is at a gentle simmer, and cover and cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally until the lamb is tender. </step>
    <step num="3">To make the Jeweled Vegetable Pilau, use a separate large, shallow pot, melt the ghee over medium heat. Add the sliced red onions and cook until soft and slightly caramelized, for about 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the cabbage, carrots, garlic, and ginger, and sauté until vegetables have softened and cooked down. </step>
    <step num="5">Season with salt, pepper, ground cumin, curry powder, and cardamom. </step>
    <step num="6">Stir in the rice and add the water. Add the bay leaf, cinnamon stick, and star anise. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 20-25 minutes until water is absorbed and rice is slightly fluffy. </step>
    <step num="7">Discard the bay leaf, cinnamon stick, and star anise. Stir the rice well before transferring to a large serving platter. </step>
    <step num="8">Create a small well in the middle of the rice, and spoon the lamb over the top. </step>
    <step num="9">Serve garnished with scallions, cashews, and pomegranate seeds. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
