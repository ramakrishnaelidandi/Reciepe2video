  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set a wire rack inside. </step>
    <step num="1">Pat the chicken thighs dry with a paper towel. Generously season the chicken on both sides with the herb salt, rubbing underneath the skin. Let sit for 15-20 minutes to draw out the moisture from the chicken skin, which will result in crispier chicken. </step>
    <step num="2">After resting, pat the chicken thighs dry once more to remove any excess moisture. Drizzle the olive oil under the skin and rub into the chicken. </step>
    <step num="3">Place the chicken thighs skin-side up on the wire rack. Bake for 30 minutes, until the skin is crispy and the internal temperature reaches 155-160˚F (68-71˚C). </step>
    <step num="4">Let the thighs rest for 15 minutes to bring the internal temperature to 165˚F (75˚C) and to let the juices settle. </step>
    <step num="5">Enjoy! </step>
