  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Bring a small pot of water to a boil, then place a strainer over the top. Add the green beans to the strainer, cover, and steam for 10-15 minutes, or until fork-tender. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion. Cook for 2 minutes, or until semi-translucent. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the mushrooms and cook for 5-6 minutes, until they have released the majority of their juices. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the garlic, and soy sauce. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant. </step>
    <step num="4">Stir in the flour to make a roux, then season with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="5">While stirring continuously, pour in the non-dairy milk and bring to a boil. Cook for 4-5 minutes, until the sauce has thickened. </step>
    <step num="6">Stir in the green beans and ½ cup (75 g) of the fried onions, until combined. Transfer to a medium baking dish and sprinkle on the remaining cup of fried onions. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 20 minutes, or until bubbling. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve warm. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
