  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Add the sweet potatoes to a baking sheet. Sprinkle with the garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper, and drizzle with olive oil. Toss until the sweet potato is well-coated in the spices, then spread out evenly. Bake for 15 minutes, or until tender. </step>
    <step num="2">In a small bowl, add the pumpkin seeds, chili powder, 1 tablespoon maple syrup, and salt, and mix until well-combined. Spread the pumpkin seeds out on a baking sheet so they’re not touching each other. </step>
    <step num="3">Add to the oven with the sweet potato and bake for 10 minutes, stirring halfway through, until toasted. </step>
    <step num="4">In a liquid measuring cup, combine the tahini, remaining tablespoon of maple syrup, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Mix well, then add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until desired consistency is reached. </step>
    <step num="5">In a large bowl, drizzle the kale with olive oil. Massage with your hands until the kale is tender and has reduced in volume by about a third. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the quinoa, roasted sweet potatoes, red onion, and pumpkin seeds. Drizzle with tahini dressing and toss well. </step>
    <step num="7">Serve with more dressing if desired. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
