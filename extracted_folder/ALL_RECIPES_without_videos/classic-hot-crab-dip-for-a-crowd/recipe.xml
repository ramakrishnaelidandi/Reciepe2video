  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 325˚F (160˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Melt the butter in a medium pan over medium-low heat. Add the onion, garlic, and salt. Cook for 12-15 minutes, until the onions are caramelized. Remove from heat and transfer to a small bowl to cool completely. </step>
    <step num="2">Using a fine-mesh strainer, drain crab meat over a bowl. </step>
    <step num="3">In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, Worcestershire, hot sauce, Old Bay, and lemon juice. Using an electric mixer, beat together until well combined. With a flexible spatula, fold in the onion mixture, ¾ cup (75 grams) cheddar cheese, and the crab meat. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the dip to a 1-quart baking dish. Top evenly with the remaining cheddar cheese. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the mixture is just beginning to bubble around the edges and the cheese is melted. </step>
    <step num="6">Heat the broiler to low. Broil dip for 3 minutes, until the whole surface is bubbling and browned. Remove the dip from the oven. Let cool for at least 15 minutes, until set. </step>
    <step num="7">Garnish the dip with Old Bay and chives. Serve with carrot sticks, celery sticks, crackers, and crostini. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
