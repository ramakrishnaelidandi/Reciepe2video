  <steps>
    <step num="0">Slice the cheese into sticks (about the size of string cheese). </step>
    <step num="1">Season the ground beef with salt and pepper (or your favorite seasoning mix) and split it up into 5-6 palm-sized balls (you may want to do five and keep a bit of excess ground beef for an omelet or a slider the next day). </step>
    <step num="2">Flatten each ball out into a rectangle. </step>
    <step num="3">Place a cheese stick towards the bottom. Roll it up, making sure that the ground beef is evenly concealing the cheese stick. </step>
    <step num="4">Place the soon-to-be burger dogs on a hot grill. Grill for 6-10 minutes, turning the dogs when charred grill marks appear on a side. You’ll need to do 3-4 turns (or more) to make sure you have even cooking around each dog. </step>
    <step num="5">Burgers should be done when some cheese starts oozing out along with meat juice. </step>
    <step num="6">Serve on hot dog buns with your favorite burger or hot dog condiments. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
