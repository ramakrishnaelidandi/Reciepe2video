  <steps>
    <step num="0">Add the potatoes to a large pot. Cover the potatoes with cold water and season with 1 tablespoon of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until the potatoes are fork tender, about 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Make the sausage filling: Add the onion to a large skillet over medium heat and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the peppers and cook until slightly tender, about 6 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the garlic and sausage. Cook until the sausage is browned, about 4 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Season with the paprika, cayenne, pepper, thyme, and salt and cook for another 5 minutes until seasoning is evenly distributed. Remove the pan from the heat. </step>
    <step num="5">Make the egg filling: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, then sauté the spinach until fully wilted, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the eggs and scramble until cooked, about 3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the bacon, pepper, and salt and mix to incorporate. Remove the pan from the heat. </step>
    <step num="8">Transfer the potatoes to a colander and run under cold water to cool. Pat dry. </step>
    <step num="9">Using the large holes on a cheese grater, shred the potatoes into a large bowl. </step>
    <step num="10">Add the flour, Parmesan, onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, and salt. Mix together thoroughly. </step>
    <step num="11">Transfer half of the hash brown mixture to a greased 13” x 18” (33 cm x 45 cm) baking sheet and spread evenly with a spatula. </step>
    <step num="12">On the left side of the tray, spoon the egg filling into 4 evenly spaced piles. On the right side of the tray, spoon the sausage filling into 4 evenly spaced piles. Top each pile of egg filling with a tablespoon of shredded cheddar cheese. </step>
    <step num="13">Top the piles of filling with the remaining hash brown mixture and use a spatula to carefully press down the hash browns, sealing the filling inside. Use the tip of the spatula to delineate between each pocket of filling. </step>
    <step num="14">Freeze for at least 2 hours. </step>
    <step num="15">In a large pot, heat oil until it reaches 380˚F (195˚C). </step>
    <step num="16">Remove the hash browns from the freezer and use a sharp knife to cut and separate each pocket. </step>
    <step num="17">Fry the hash brown pockets in batches for 5-7 minutes, or until browned on both sides. Drain the pockets on a wire rack set over a baking sheet lined with paper towels. </step>
