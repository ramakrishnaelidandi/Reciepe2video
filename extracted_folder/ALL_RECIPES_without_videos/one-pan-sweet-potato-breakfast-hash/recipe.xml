    <step num="0">Dice the sweet potato </step>
    <step num="1">Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the diced sweet potato, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, or until it begins to soften. </step>

    <step num="4">Dice the jalapeño, if using, and add. </step>
    <step num="5">Chop the green onion and rosemary, if using fresh, and add to skillet. Cover and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the sweet potato is tender. </step>
    <step num="6">Create 4 wells in the vegetable mixture, not too close to the edges of the skillet, but far enough apart that they aren't touching. Crack 1 egg into each well. Cover and cook for 3-5 minutes more, or the eggs are cooked to your liking. </step>
