  <steps>
    <step num="0">On a large plate, arrange the sausage and the ham in a circle, then place a microwaveable mug in the center. </step>
    <step num="1">Crack the eggs into the mug, season with salt, pepper, and add a splash of milk. Stir until evenly mixed. </step>
    <step num="2">Microwave the entire plate for about 2 minutes until the egg is cooked through, making sure it does not bubble over. </step>
    <step num="3">Remove the plate and microwave the bacon strips on a separate plate for about 4-7 minutes. Check the bacon at 4 minutes, then every minute or so to make sure it doesn’t burn. </step>
    <step num="4">Drain the bacon of its fat, then set aside. </step>
    <step num="5">Invert the mug with the egg, then slice the egg cylinder into 5 equal rounds. You may have to run a knife around the mug first to ensure that the egg comes loose in one solid piece. </step>
    <step num="6">To assemble, layer your sandwich as you’d like with the meat, egg, cheese, and spinach. </step>
    <step num="7">Wrap each sandwich in a damp paper towel, then with parchment paper. Place the sandwiches in a large zip top bag, then freeze for up until 1 month. </step>
    <step num="8">When ready to eat, remove a sandwich from the freezer, unwrap the parchment, and microwave for about 2 minutes. Cool for 1 minute, then unwrap the paper towel. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
