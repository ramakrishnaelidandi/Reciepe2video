  <steps>
    <step num="0">Butterfly each chicken breast. Lay a piece of parchment paper on top and pound to about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick. Season generously on both sides with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="1">Cut each breast in half lengthwise so you have 4 pieces of chicken. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the flour to a wide, shallow dish. Dredge each piece of chicken in flour, shaking off the excess. </step>
    <step num="3">Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the chicken until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour the white wine into the pan and cook until reduced by half, about 1 minute. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the butter, garlic, and capers and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Stir in the lemon juice and chicken stock and cook for 5 minutes, until the sauce has slightly thickened. </step>
    <step num="7">Stir in the cream, then return the chicken to the pan. </step>
    <step num="8">Sprinkle with the parsley and turn the chicken to coat in the sauce. Simmer for 2 minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly, then remove from the heat. </step>
    <step num="9">Serve the chicken and sauce over angel hair pasta. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
