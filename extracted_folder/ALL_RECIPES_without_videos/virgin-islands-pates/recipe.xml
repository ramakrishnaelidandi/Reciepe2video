  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, mix together the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the cold shortening and water, and mix until evenly incorporated, but still crumbly. </step>
    <step num="2">Transfer the dough onto a work surface and knead until the dough just comes together, about 1 minute. </step>
    <step num="3">Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, and let it rest for an hour at room temperature. </step>
    <step num="4">Heat a skillet on medium high with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the onion, bell peppers, celery, garlic, salt, pepper, dried oregano, dried parsley, dried thyme, and the scotch bonnet pepper, and cook until all the vegetables are soft and slightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the tomato paste and cook until aromatic and slightly caramelized, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the ground beef. Cook until the meat is browned, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. </step>
    <step num="8">Unwrap the rested dough and roll it out on a work surface until ⅛ of an inch (3 mm) in thickness. Using an inverted 6-inch (15-cm) wide bowl, cut out circles of the dough to set aside. Remove the excess and re-roll it to cut out more dough circles. </step>
    <step num="9">Take a dough circle and place ½ cup (110 G) of filling into the center of the circle, leaving about 1½ inches (3-cm) of room around the edges. </step>
    <step num="10">Dip your finger in water and brush the edge of the dough. Fold the dough over the filling to meet the opposite end and press the dough ends together to form a half-moon shape. Firmly press down the two edges to become one, and decorate the new crust with the prongs of a fork. Make sure the pastry is completely sealed. </step>
    <step num="11">Preheat fryer oil in a large pot on high heat to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="12">Place the pates into the heated deep fryer, one at a time, for about 5 minutes or until they puff up and the outside turns golden brown. Remove from the fryer and let them drain on a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
