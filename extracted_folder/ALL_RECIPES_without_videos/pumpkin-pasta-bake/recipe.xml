  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Cook the pasta according to package instructions. In the meantime, prepare the sauce. </step>
    <step num="1">Place saucepan on medium heat. Coat with olive oil, then pour in shallots and cook until they begin to soften (3-5 minutes). </step>
    <step num="2">Add sage and thyme, stir, and cook until fragrant. </step>
    <step num="3">Bring heat down to low and add the pumpkin and ricotta. Stir until well-combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Add milk, stir, add parmesan, stir. </step>
    <step num="5">Add brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and pepper, stir well-blended. </step>
    <step num="6">Combine the sauce with cooked pasta and stir until evenly distributed. </step>
    <step num="7">Scoop the pasta into a baking dish or a pumpkin, like we did! Top off with mozzarella cheese. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake covered for 15-20 minutes (until cheese has melted). </step>
    <step num="9">Then broil for a quick 2-3 minutes if you want the cheese on top to brown and get toasty. Keep on eye on it while it’s broiling to make sure you don’t overdo it. Serve immediately, before it gets cold. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
