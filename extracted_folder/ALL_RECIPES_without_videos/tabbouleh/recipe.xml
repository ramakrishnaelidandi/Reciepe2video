    <step num="1">Chop the parsley very finely and transfer to a medium bowl. </step>
    <step num="2">Mince the tomatoes and transfer to a fine-mesh strainer, then set the strainer over another medium bowl. Sprinkle the tomatoes with a pinch of salt and mix.

    <step num="3">Rinse the bulgur in a fine-mesh strainer under cold running water and drain well. </step>
