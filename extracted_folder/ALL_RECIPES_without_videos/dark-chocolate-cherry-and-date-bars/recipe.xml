  <steps>
    <step num="0">Line an 8-inch (20 cm) square pan with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">In a food processor, combine the dates, almond butter, and coconut oil. Process until well combined, about 30 seconds. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the puffed rice, cherries, and almonds and pulse 5-6 times—just enough so that everything is well incorporated. </step>
    <step num="3">Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan and press into an even layer about ½ inch (1 ¼ cm) thick. Freeze for 15 minutes, until set. </step>
    <step num="4">Meanwhile, pour the water into a small saucepan. Place a heatproof glass or metal bowl over the saucepan, making sure the water is not touching the bottom. Bring the water to a simmer, then add the chocolate to the warm bowl and let it melt, stirring slowly. Remove the bowl from the heat as soon as the chocolate is melted and smooth. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour the melted chocolate over the date and cherry mixture and spread evenly with a spatula. Sprinkle with flaky salt. Return the pan to the freezer for another 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Once set, cut into 16 bars. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
