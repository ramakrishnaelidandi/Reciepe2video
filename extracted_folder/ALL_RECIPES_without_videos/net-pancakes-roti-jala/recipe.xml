  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, water, coconut milk, eggs, salt, and turmeric until smooth. (If any clumps remain, run mixture through a sieve.) </step>
    <step num="1">Using a sharp-pointed knife (a corkscrew or nail works just as well), poke three holes in the cap of a plastic water bottle. </step>
    <step num="2">Fill the bottle with your pancake batter. </step>
    <step num="3">Heat a very lightly greased nonstick skillet over medium heat. Working quickly, invert the water bottle and drizzle the batter in quick circular motions forming a netlike pattern. </step>
    <step num="4">Allow the pancake to cook for one to two minutes. Do not flip and watch closely so it doesn’t burn. </step>
    <step num="5">Remove from pan, fold in the sides, and roll up. Serve with curry. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
