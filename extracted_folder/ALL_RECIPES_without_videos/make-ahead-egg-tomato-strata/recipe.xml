  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and salt. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the bread and toss so that all of the bread is saturated with liquid. </step>
    <step num="2">Refrigerate the mixture and let it sit for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. </step>
    <step num="3">When you’re ready to bake the strata, preheat the oven to 375°F. </step>
    <step num="4">Take the egg and bread mixture out of the fridge and add the tomatoes, chickpeas, basil, and goat cheese to the mixing bowl. Toss everything together to thoroughly combine. </step>
    <step num="5">Heat olive oil in a large, oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Swirl the oil to coat the bottom and at least an inch up the sides. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour the combined ingredients into the skillet, then use a spatula to spread everything evenly over the skillet, pressing the bread into a flat, even layer. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake the strata in the preheated oven until the eggs are completely set and the edges are golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">Take the strata out of the oven and let it sit in the pan for at least 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Flip the cooled strata out of the pan and onto a cutting board, then slice it into four portions. </step>
    <step num="10">Eat immediately, or let the strata cool completely before storing in an airtight container in the fridge. </step>
    <step num="11">Note: To reheat the strata: Microwave for 1 minute on high, or reheat in a 375°F oven for 5 minutes, just to heat through. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
