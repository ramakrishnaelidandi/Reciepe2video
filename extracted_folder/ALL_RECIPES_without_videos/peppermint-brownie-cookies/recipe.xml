  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180˚C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick baking mats. </step>
    <step num="1">Bring a small pot of water to a simmer. Add the chocolate chips, butter, and peppermint extract to a medium heatproof bowl and place over the simmering water. Melt, stirring often until smooth, about 10 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat and set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, Dutch-process cocoa powder, and black cocoa powder. Whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the eggs to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or a large bowl with an electric hand mixer and whip on high speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Continue mixing while slowly adding the granulated and brown sugar until the mixture is pale and falls into ribbons, about 9 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the melted chocolate mixture to the whipped eggs and mix on low speed until just combined. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the dry ingredients and mix again until smooth. </step>
    <step num="6">Using an ice cream scoop, immediately scoop the cookies onto the prepared baking sheets and smooth the tops with your finger. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 8 minutes, then remove the cookies from the oven and sprinkle the tops with crushed candy canes. Return the cookies to the oven and bake for another 4 minutes, until the tops are cracked and shiny. Remove from the oven and immediately smack the baking sheets against the countertop, then let the cookies cool completely on the pans. </step>
    <step num="8">Note: If black cocoa powder is not available in your grocery store, cookies can be made using 3 tablespoons of Dutch-process cocoa powder; simply swapping the black cocoa for the Dutch-process. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
