  <steps>
    <step num="0">Slice the chicken breast in half lengthwise to create thinner cutlets. Using the bumpy side of a meat mallet, pound the chicken until ¼-inch (6 mm) thick. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the flour, eggs, and bread crumbs to 3 separate, shallow dishes. </step>
    <step num="2">To the dish with the eggs, add the parsley, garlic, and milk. Season with salt and pepper. Mix with a fork to combine. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="4">Working 1 piece at a time, coat the chicken cutlets in the flour, shaking off any excess, then the egg mixture, then the bread crumbs. Set the coated chicken on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="5">Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add enough olive oil to come ¼ inch (6 mm) up the sides of the pan. Working in batches, fry the chicken until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per side. Add more oil as needed for subsequent batches. Drain the chicken on paper towels to absorb any excess oil. Season with a pinch of salt. </step>
    <step num="6">Serve the chicken with lemon wedges. The dish pairs well with pan-roasted potatoes and tomato salad. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
