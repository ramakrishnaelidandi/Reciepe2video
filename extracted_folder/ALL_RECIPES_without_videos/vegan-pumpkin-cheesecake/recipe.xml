  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a 10-inch (25-cm) springform pan with parchment paper and grease the sides with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="1">Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the cashews and boil for 10 minutes, until fork-tender. Drain and set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the graham crackers to a food processor and pulse until they break down into crumbs. Pour in the coconut oil and pulse until combined. Transfer to a medium bowl and clean out the food processor. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the cashews, tofu, pumpkin puree, sugar, cornstarch, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract, lemon juice, and salt to the food processor. Puree for 5-8 minutes, or until the mixture is completely smooth and not at all gritty. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the graham cracker crumbs to the prepared pan. Use a flat-bottomed measuring cup to help pack the crust in an even layer. </step>
    <step num="5">Using a spatula, spread the filling over the crust in an even layer. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the cheesecake is set. </step>
    <step num="7">Refrigerate uncovered for at least 4 hours, or overnight. </step>
    <step num="8">Unmold the cheesecake, then slice and serve with non-dairy whipped cream. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
