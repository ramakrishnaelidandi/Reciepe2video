  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Using an 8-inch (20-cm) round cake pan, cut a circle out from the puff pastry. Using a fork, poke holes all over the pastry to provide ventilation. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Cut the tops and bottoms off of the bananas, then halve 2 of the bananas crosswise and set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter, then add the brown sugar and cook until fully incorporated and the sauce appears amber in color, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the vanilla and cinnamon. Stir until combined. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the bananas to the pan and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Turn the bananas to fully coat them with the caramel, then remove from the pan. Reserve the caramel. </step>
    <step num="7">Grease the cake pan. Arrange the bananas on the bottom of the pan. Pour over the caramel sauce. </step>
    <step num="8">Cover the bananas with the circle of puff pastry and ensure the edges are tucked into the pan. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 30 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed and golden. </step>
    <step num="10">Let cool at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before inverting onto a serving plate. </step>
    <step num="11">Slice and serve with vanilla ice cream. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
