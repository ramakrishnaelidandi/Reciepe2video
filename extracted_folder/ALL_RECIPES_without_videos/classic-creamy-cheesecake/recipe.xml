  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Grease a 10-inch (25 cm) springform pan with nonstick spray. Line the inside edges of the pan with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">In the bowl of a food processor, combine the graham crackers, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and the melted butter. Pulse to combine until the texture is similar to wet sand. </step>
    <step num="2">Press the graham cracker crumbs into the prepared pan, using a measuring cup to compact in even layer. </step>
    <step num="3">Bake for 8-10 minutes, until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature. </step>
    <step num="4">Once cool, line the sides of the springform pan with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="5">In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese, remaining 2 cups (400 G) of sugar, and the salt. Using an electric hand mixer, blend until well-combined and fluffy. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the heavy cream and beat to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the sour cream, flour, salt, and vanilla bean seeds, and beat to combine. </step>
    <step num="8">Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and mix until fully combined, making sure not to over-beat. The mixture should be smooth and creamy. </step>
    <step num="9">Pour the cream cheese mixture into the cooled crust. </step>
    <step num="10">Wrap the outside of the springform pan tightly with foil and place the pan in a large baking dish. Fill the dish with 1 inch (2 cm) of boiling water. </step>
    <step num="11">Gently transfer the baking dish to the oven and bake for 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="12">Without opening the oven door, turn off the heat and let the cheesecake rest for 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="13">Remove the springform pan from the baking dish and unwrap the foil. Run a paring knife gently around the outside of the cheesecake to loosen it from the sides of the pan. </step>
    <step num="14">Cover the pan with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator overnight. </step>
    <step num="15">Remove the cheesecake from the refrigerator and release the springform pan. Remove the parchment paper lining. </step>
    <step num="16">Top with fresh berries, if desired. </step>
    <step num="17">Dip a knife into hot water for clean slices, then slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="18">Enjoy! </step>
