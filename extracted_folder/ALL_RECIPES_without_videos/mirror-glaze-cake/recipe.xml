  <steps>
    <step num="0">Spread the jam evenly into the bottom of a round 8-inch (20 cm) cake pan, then place one of the cake rounds on top. Freeze completely. </step>
    <step num="1">In a 9-inch by 3-inch (23 cm 8 cm) by silicone round cake mold, pour ⅔ of the chocolate mousse then tap the mold on the table to release any air bubbles. </step>
    <step num="2">Place the frozen cake &amp; jam disc on top of the mousse, jam-side down. Press the cake down slightly, then cover it with the rest of the mousse. </step>
    <step num="3">Place the 2nd cake round on top, pressing down until the mousse rises to the level of the cake. </step>
    <step num="4">Carefully transfer to a freezer and freeze overnight. It is vital that the cake is 100% frozen through. </step>
    <step num="5">Place a can on top of a baking sheet, then carefully unmold the cake onto the can. Make sure to work quickly and that the glaze is already prepared. </step>
    <step num="6">When the mirror glaze is between 90 and 96°F (32 - 35°C) , pour the glaze over the cake in a circular motion, making sure to start in the center and work your way outwards. </step>
    <step num="7">You only have one chance to glaze the cake, since the glaze will start to set due to the cold temperature of the cake, so do not pour a 2nd round of glaze after the first one. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
