  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C. </step>
    <step num="1">Place the 8 hot dog buns in a 9x13 inch (22x33 cm) baking dish, then cut a rectangle in each hot dog bun, making sure to stay 1 centimeter from the edges. </step>
    <step num="2">Push down on the bread cut-out and compact this portion of the bun tightly into the bottom of each bun, making sure to press down on the bottom edges as well. This will help create a larger space for the fillings and reduce mess. </step>
    <step num="3">Mix the butter, garlic, and parsley in a small bowl, then brush the buns and their hollowed insides with the garlic butter. Bake for 5 minutes to toast the buns as well as help the sides of the buns firm up so they don’t collapse under the weight of the fillings. </step>
    <step num="4">Place a slice of cheddar cheese inside each bun, then spoon a bit of chili inside each one. </step>
    <step num="5">Slide the hot dog snugly on top of the chili, then top with more chili. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown and the chili has started to brown. </step>
    <step num="7">Top with fresh parsley, then slice the hot dogs boats along their connected seams to serve. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
