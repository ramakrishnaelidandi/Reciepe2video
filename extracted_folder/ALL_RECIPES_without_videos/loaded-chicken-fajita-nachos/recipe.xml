    <step num="5">Lay down half the tortilla chips on the skillet, followed by half the fajita mixture, and top with pepper Jack and cheddar cheese. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake until the cheese has melted, about 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Add your choice of topping (optional). </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
