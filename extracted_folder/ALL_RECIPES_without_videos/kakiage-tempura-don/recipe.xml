  <steps>
    <step num="0">Whisk the egg in a small bowl. Add flour and the cold water, and whisk to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator. </step>
    <step num="1">To make the tempura, slice the eggplant in half lengthwise, then cut the bottom into 5 slices (be careful not to cut all the way through to the top). </step>
    <step num="2">Add flour to a shallow dish. Coat the eggplant, pumpkin, green bell pepper, and shrimp in the flour, shaking off any excess. </step>
    <step num="3">Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350°F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="4">Dip the floured vegetables and shrimp into the batter. </step>
    <step num="5">Fry the battered shrimp and vegetables until they float to the top and are golden brown in color. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. </step>
    <step num="6">To make the kakiage, put the onion, carrot, Japanese parsley and dried shrimp into a medium bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of flour and toss to coat. Pour the leftover tempura batter on the top and mix until evenly coated. </step>
    <step num="7">Bring the oil in the pot back to 350°F (180˚C). Drop the kakiage by the spoonful into the oil and fry until golden brown in color. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. </step>
    <step num="8">In a medium pan, combine the soy sauce, mirin and sugar, and bring to a boil over high heat for 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Top the rice with kakiage and tempura and drizzle with the sauce. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
