  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C). Generously grease a 9 (22 cm) x 4 (10 cm) loaf pan with oil. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, and salt. Add the oats and whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">In a separate large bowl, combine the shredded carrots, pineapple, eggs, and melted butter. Mix well. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until there are no dry clumps left. Gently fold in the walnuts, if using. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 1 hour, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean. </step>
    <step num="6">While the bread is baking, make the Greek yogurt “frosting”: In a small bowl, combine the Greek yogurt, maple syrup, and 2 tablespoons of the reserved pineapple juice. Stir until well incorporated. Chill in the refrigerator until ready to use. </step>
    <step num="7">Remove the bread from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes, until safe to handle. Remove from the loaf pan and let cool completely on a wire rack. </step>
    <step num="8">Slice the bread and serve with a smear of frosting. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
