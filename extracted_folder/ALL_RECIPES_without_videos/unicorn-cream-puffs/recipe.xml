  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a pot over low heat, combine egg yolks, heavy cream, sugar, and cornstarch. </step>
    <step num="2">Turn the heat up to medium-high, whisking constantly to prevent any lumps. Allow the mixture to thicken, stirring until smooth. </step>
    <step num="3">Transfer the custard into three small bowls. Drop different colors of dye in each bowl and mix. </step>
    <step num="4">Cover the tops of each bowl with plastic wrap and press down onto the surface of the custard to prevent skin from forming. Chill in the refrigerator. </step>
    <step num="5">In a pot, combine the water, salt, and butter, bringing it to a boil. Add the flour and stir until the dough comes together in a ball. Remove from heat. </step>
    <step num="6">Add in the eggs, one a time, stirring until the dough becomes a paste. Add the vanilla and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer the dough into a piping bag with a large round tip. </step>
    <step num="8">On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, pipe 1-inch ( 2 ½ cm) mounds. (To form a more rounded shape, dab your finger with a little water and press down on the mound to eliminate the peak.) </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 20 minutes until the pastry has risen considerably and the insides are dry. </step>
    <step num="10">Allow the pastries to cool. Then, using the tip of a knife, cut a small “x” into the bottom of each pastry and transfer (“x” side up) to a cooling rack. This will allow any excess steam or moisture to escape, ensuring your pastries maintain their shape. </step>
    <step num="11">Transfer the custard to a piping back alternating the colors in order for the custard to swirl inside the pastry. </step>
    <step num="12">Fill each pastry with custard. </step>
    <step num="13">In a bowl, melt the white chocolate chips and vanilla, and swirl teal, pink, and purple dye in order to create a purple marble shell. </step>
    <step num="14">Dip the top of each cream puff in the chocolate and garnish with sprinkles of your choice. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
