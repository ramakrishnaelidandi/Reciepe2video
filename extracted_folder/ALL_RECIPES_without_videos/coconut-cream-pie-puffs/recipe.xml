  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 425˚F (220˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">To make the cream filling whisk together egg yolks, half and half, and coconut milk in a medium saucepan over medium/low heat. </step>
    <step num="2">Once combined, add in sugar and corn starch, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens and comes to a light boil. </step>
    <step num="3">Remove from heat and mix in the shredded coconut and vanilla extract. Cover with plastic wrap and chill at least two hours. </step>
    <step num="4">To make the puff, combine the butter, water, coconut milk, and salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Allow all the butter to melt and bring the mixture to a boil. </step>
    <step num="5">As soon as the mixture begins to boil, reduce heat to medium-low and add in the flour. </step>
    <step num="6">Using a wooden spoon, mix thoroughly to incorporate the flour. Continue stirring until the dough starts to pull away from the sides and a thin film forms on the bottom of the pan (about three minutes). </step>
    <step num="7">Remove the mixture from heat and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Let the dough cool slightly. </step>
    <step num="8">Add in the eggs, one at a time, being sure to fully incorporate each egg before adding the next. </step>
    <step num="9">Once the dough comes together, transfer it to a piping bag. </step>
    <step num="10">Pipe onto a parchment-paper-lined baking sheet into 1½-inch (3 ¾ cm) mounds. </step>
    <step num="11">Smooth out any peaks/ridges cause by piping with a wet fingertip (this will ensure your puffs cook evenly and maintain a nice ball shape). </step>
    <step num="12">Then brush the dough with egg wash and place in preheated oven. </step>
    <step num="13">Bake for 15 minutes at 425˚F (220°C). Then, without opening the oven, reduce heat to 350˚ (180˚C) and bake for an additional 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="14">Remove puffs from oven. Using the tip of a knife, cut a small “x” into the bottom of each puff and transfer (“x” side up) to a cooling rack. </step>
    <step num="15">Just before serving (or up to two hours in advance), pipe the cream filling into the cooled puffs. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. </step>
    <step num="16">Enjoy! </step>
