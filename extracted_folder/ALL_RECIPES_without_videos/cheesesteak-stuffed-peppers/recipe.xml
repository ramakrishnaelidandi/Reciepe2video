  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Cut the flank steak against the grain into ⅛-inch (3-mm) thick slices. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil, until shimmering. Add the steak, paprika, garlic powder, ½ teaspoon of pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt, and the Worcestershire sauce. </step>
    <step num="3">Mix to coat the meat with the spices and cook until the meat is cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer the meat a bowl, leaving the juices in the pan. Cover and set aside until ready to use. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the butter to the pan with the meat juices. Add the onions and cook until tender and shiny, about 10 minutes. Add the green bell peppers and the remaining ½ teaspoon of pepper and teaspoon of salt, and cook until the onions and peppers are caramelized, about 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Cut the top off of a red bell pepper. Cut around the seed pod, then pull it out of the pepper. Remove any remaining seeds. Repeat with the rest of the peppers. </step>
    <step num="6">Cut 9 of the provolone slices in half. </step>
    <step num="7">Place the peppers in a 9x13-inch (23x33-cm) baking dish, cut side up. Scoop a bit of steak filling into each pepper, followed by the peppers and onions, then 3 half slices of provolone. Repeat with the rest of the steak, then the rest of the peppers and onions. Place a whole slice of provolone on top of each pepper. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 30 minutes, until the skin of the peppers is shriveling, and the cheese is golden. </step>
    <step num="9">Top with parsley. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
