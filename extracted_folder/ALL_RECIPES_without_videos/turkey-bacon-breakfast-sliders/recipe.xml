  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat Griddler, fitted with the griddle plates, to 425째F (220째C) and grease with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="1">On a cutting board, arrange 4 slices of turkey bacon vertically directly next to each other. Weave the 5 remaining bacon slices horizontally through the vertical pieces. </step>
    <step num="2">Wrap the bacon weave onto a rolling pin, taking care to keep it intact. Carefully transfer the bacon to the griddle and carefully unroll in an even layer. </step>
    <step num="3">Close the Griddler and cook for 8 minutes, until the bacon is fully cooked and has begun to crisp up. Remove the bacon weave from the Griddler. </step>
    <step num="4">Use a bread knife to slice the intact loaf of rolls crosswise so that the bottoms can be separated from the tops. Set aside the top half. </step>
    <step num="5">Place the bacon weave on the bottom half of the rolls. </step>
    <step num="6">Distribute the scrambled eggs on top of the bacon weave, smoothing them into an even layer. </step>
    <step num="7">Place the cheese on top of the eggs, covering as much area as possible. </step>
    <step num="8">Place the lettuce on top of the cheese. </step>
    <step num="9">Place the tomato slices evenly on top of the lettuce leaves. </step>
    <step num="10">Replace the top half of the rolls and slice the individual sliders. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
