    <step num="0">In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together with an electric hand mixer for 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy. </step>

    <step num="3">Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt into the bowl and beat for 3 minutes, or until a crumbly dough forms. </step>
    <step num="4">Turn out the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and fold the wrap over the dough on all 4 sides to create a square dough block about ½ inch (1 ¼ cm) thick. Refrigerate the dough for 2 hours. </step>

    <step num="9">Brush a thick layer of egg wash onto the cookies. </step>
