  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 200°F (95°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Generously season all sides of the steak with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="2">Transfer to a wire rack on top of a baking sheet, then bake for about 45 minutes to an hour until the internal temperature reads about 125°F (51° C) for medium-rare. Adjust the bake time based on if you like your steak more rare or more well-done. </step>
    <step num="3">Heat the canola oil in a pan over high heat until smoking. </step>
    <step num="4">Sear the steak for 30 seconds on the first side, then flip. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the butter, garlic, rosemary, and thyme, and swirl around the pan. </step>
    <step num="6">Transfer the garlic and herbs on top of the steak and baste the steak with the butter using a large spoon. </step>
    <step num="7">Baste for about 30 seconds, then flip and baste the other side for about 15 seconds. </step>
    <step num="8">Turn the steak on its side and cook to render off any excess fat. </step>
    <step num="9">Rest the steak on a cutting board or wire rack for about 10 minutes. Slicing the steak before the resting period has finished will result in a lot of the juices leaking out, which may not be desirable. </step>
    <step num="10">Slice the steak into ½ -inch (1 cm) strips, then fan out the slices and serve. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
