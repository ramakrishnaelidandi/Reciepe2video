  <steps>
    <step num="0">Thaw the ice cream at room temperature until it is soft to the touch, about 20 minutes, so it will pass through the ricer easily. </step>
    <step num="1">Over a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, fill the potato ricer with ice cream and press it through, so the ice cream forms “spaghetti”-like noodle piles. Freeze until firm, at least 45 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Transfer the “spaghetti” to a serving plate. </step>
    <step num="3">Carefully spoon over the strawberry sundae topping to mimic marinara sauce, and top with the brownie bite “meatballs,” if using. Grate white chocolate over the top to mimic Parmesan cheese. </step>
    <step num="4">Enjoy! </step>
