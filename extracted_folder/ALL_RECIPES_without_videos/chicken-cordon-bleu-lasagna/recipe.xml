  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Slice the chicken breasts in half into cutlets and season with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="2">In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, pepper, 2 teaspoons oregano, 2 teaspoons onion powder, 2 teaspoons basil, and 2 teaspoons garlic powder. </step>
    <step num="3">In another medium bowl, beat the eggs. </step>
    <step num="4">In another medium bowl, combine 1½ cups (75 G) of panko bread crumbs, the remaining 2 teaspoons garlic powder, 2 teaspoons basil, 2 teaspoons onion powder, and 2 teaspoons oregano. </step>
    <step num="5">In a large skillet, heat the canola oil over medium-high heat. </step>
    <step num="6">Bread the chicken cutlets by coating in the flour mixture, then in the egg, and finally in the panko. </step>
