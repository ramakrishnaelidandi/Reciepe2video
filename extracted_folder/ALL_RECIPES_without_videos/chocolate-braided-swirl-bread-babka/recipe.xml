  <steps>
    <step num="0">Combine the yeast and warm milk and let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">In large mixing bowl, add the egg, egg yolks, vanilla, sugar, and honey and whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">Add in the milk and yeast mixture and whisk until fully incorporated. </step>
    <step num="3">Gradually add in the flour and mix until fully incorporated. </step>
    <step num="4">Gradually add in the butter and mix until fully incorporated. </step>
    <step num="5">Cover with a towel and let rest for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Bring out the dough onto floured work surface and knead until smooth. </step>
    <step num="7">Divide the dough into two equal parts and place in bowls and cover each with plastic wrap. Let the dough sit at room temperature for at least two hours, or when it has doubled in size. </step>
    <step num="8">Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C). </step>
    <step num="9">For the chocolate sauce, combine bittersweet chocolate, butter, sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, espresso powder, and turbinado sugar in a medium sized mixing bowl and microwave for 1-2 minutes. Stir to combine and set aside. </step>
    <step num="10">Once the dough has doubled in size, transfer to a floured work surface and roll both pieces of dough into a rectangle roughly 10x15-inches. </step>
    <step num="11">Cover the dough with half of the chocolate sauce leaving an ½ inch - 1 inch of room on all sides. </step>
    <step num="12">Gently roll the dough up and repeat with second piece of dough and remaining chocolate sauce. </step>
    <step num="13">Using a bench scraper or a knife, carefully cut each log vertically in half making sure the seam is side down. </step>
    <step num="14">Lay one piece of dough horizontally and lay another piece over it vertically so you have a rough ‘plus sign’. </step>
    <step num="15">Lay another piece horizontally over the vertical piece and above the other horizontal piece. </step>
    <step num="16">Lay the final piece vertically on the right of the other vertical piece having it go over the top horizontal piece but weaving it under the lower horizontal piece. </step>
    <step num="17">Starting with the bottom vertical piece on the right side, bring it to the left layering it over the other vertical lower piece. </step>
    <step num="18">Follow this method around the dough clockwise. </step>
    <step num="19">Once returned to the bottom lower vertical pieces. Take the original piece you crossed over (the lower left vertical piece) and cross that over to the right layering it over the last piece you used. Continue this counterclockwise until back at the bottom or you are unable to layer the dough anymore. </step>
    <step num="20">Tuck in the excess pieces of dough under the bread. </step>
    <step num="21">Transfer the bread into a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and brush with egg wash. </step>
    <step num="22">Bake for 35-45 minutes, until lightly browned and cooked through. </step>
    <step num="23">Enjoy! </step>
