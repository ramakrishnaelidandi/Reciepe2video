  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a pan over medium heat, melt butter. Add the garlic and onions, cooking until translucent. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the spinach, salt, and pepper, cooking until spinach is wilted. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the breadcrumbs, cream cheese, parmesan, and dill, stirring until mixture is evenly combined. Remove from heat and set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">On a cutting board, smooth out the sheet of puff pastry. Place the salmon in the middle of the pastry and season both sides with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="5">Place several spoonfuls of the spinach mixture on top of the salmon, smoothing it out so that it does not spill over the sides. </step>
    <step num="6">Fold the edges of the puff pastry over the salmon and spinach, starting with the longer sides and then the shorter ends. Trim any excess pastry from the ends, then fold the ends on top. Flip the puff pastry-wrapped salmon over and transfer for a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="7">Brush the beaten egg on the top and sides of the pastry. Score the top of the pastry with a knife, cutting shallow diagonal lines to create a crosshatch pattern. </step>
    <step num="8">Brush the top again with the egg wash. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 20-25 minutes, until pastry is golden brown. </step>
    <step num="10">Slice, then serve! </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
