  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C) </step>
    <step num="1">Pulse oats in a food processor or blender 10 times. </step>
    <step num="2">Add pulsed oats, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg into a bowl. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large bowl, beat softened butter with a hand mixer until creamy, add brown and white sugars, then beat until fluffy. Next beat in vanilla and eggs 1 at a time. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients ⅓ at a time until it’s gone and dough forms. </step>
    <step num="5">Fold in raisins or chocolate chunks. </step>
    <step num="6">Take 1 tablespoon of dough and roll it into a ball. Then flatten into a cookie shape and put on a well-greased parchment-lined baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake 12-15 minutes. (Top rack = no brown bottoms, bottom rack = browned bottoms and a little more crispy). </step>
    <step num="8">Cool completely and make the icing in the meantime. Combine powdered sugar, milk, and warm water in a shallow bowl. Once the cookies have cooled, dip into the icing or dab icing on with a pastry brush. Dry for 10 minutes or until icing has hardened. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
