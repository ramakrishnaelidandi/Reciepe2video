  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat your oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Freshly shred the cheese. Place your cheese in neat piles on an ungreased baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="2">Bake for about 8 minutes, until all the individual shreds melt into one disc. Be careful not to let the cheese color too much. </step>
    <step num="3">Once they are all melted, let them cool for 2 minutes on your baking sheet, then lift them onto paper towels to blot off any excess grease. </step>
    <step num="4">To form the shells, lay them over a propped up utensil. (Or you can use anything in your kitchen, a wide bowl or saucepan could work too!) Set these aside to cool. </step>
    <step num="5">To make the taco filling, brown the ground beef on high heat. Make a well in the center, add in the onion, jalapeños, garlic, and sprinkle in the taco seasoning packet. Stir to combine. Add water if you need it for a nice saucy filling. </step>
    <step num="6">Use a fork to hold your cheese shell in place and fill with the beef mixture, and toppings of your choice. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
