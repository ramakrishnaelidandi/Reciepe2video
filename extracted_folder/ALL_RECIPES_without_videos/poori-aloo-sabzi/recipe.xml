  <steps>
    <step num="0">Add the flour to a large bowl. Sprinkle the oil over the flour and mix with your hands. The mixture should feel like sand. </step>
    <step num="1">Add a bit of water at a time and knead into the flour. When the dough is ready, it should form a ball and not stick to your fingers. </step>
    <step num="2">Cover the dough with damp towel so it doesn’t dry out. </step>
    <step num="3">Heat the oil in a deep pot until it reaches 350˚F (170˚C). </step>
    <step num="4">Form the dough into ping-pong size balls. Dip the balls into a small bowl of canola oil and roll them out into flat 2-inch (5 cm) circle shapes. </step>
    <step num="5">Immediately drop the rolled dough into the oil. Use a spider to keep the dough submerged in the oil. Once it is puffed up, turn over and cook other side. Fry until golden brown, 2-3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">ALOO: Melt the ghee in a large pot over medium heat. Once the ghee is completely melted, add the cumin seeds and toast until aromatic, 2-3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the onion and ginger to the pot. Cover and cook until the onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">Add the turmeric and mix well. Add the chopped tomato and season with salt. Cover and cook until the tomato is very soft, about 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Add the curry powder and mix well. Add the potatoes and peas, and mix well to incorporate. Add the water, cover, and cook for 10 minutes, or until the soup thickens. </step>
    <step num="10">Garnish with cilantro. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
