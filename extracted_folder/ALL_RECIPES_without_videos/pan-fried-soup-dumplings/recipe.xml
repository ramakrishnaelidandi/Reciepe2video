  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a medium bowl, combine the hot water, gelatin, soy sauce, and chicken stock and mix well. Transfer the soup to a shallow heatproof tray and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour, or until set. </step>
    <step num="1">When set, fluff the soup and break up with a fork. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the flour and baking powder to a medium bowl. Pour the hot water over the flour mixture, and mix the dough gently to combine. </step>
    <step num="3">Using your hands, knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. </step>
    <step num="4">For the filling, combine the ground pork, green onion, shiitake mushroom, ginger, garlic, sugar, sake, sesame oil, and soy sauce until well mixed. </step>
    <step num="5">Roll the dough into a log. Divide it into 16 pieces. </step>
    <step num="6">Take one piece and shape into a ball, then roll into flat round using a rolling pin. Put a spoonful of filling and soup gelatin into the center of the dough. Pinch the top a couple times to close the dumpling. </step>
    <step num="7">Repeat with the remaining dough and fillings. </step>
    <step num="8">Heat the oil in a medium pan over medium heat. Set the dumplings in a pan, seam side down, pour in the water, and cover. </step>
    <step num="9">Steam the dumplings for 12 minutes. </step>
    <step num="10">Add the sesame oil in the pan, increase the heat to high, and cook until the bottoms of the dumplings are crisp. </step>
