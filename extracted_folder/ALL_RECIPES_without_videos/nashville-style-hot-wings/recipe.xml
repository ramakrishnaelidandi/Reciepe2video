  <steps>
    <step num="0">Combine all master spice mix ingredients and separate into three equal portions. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl combine chicken wings, ⅓ master spice mix, the buttermilk. Cover and chill for as long as possible (4 hours to overnight). </step>
    <step num="2">Rinse the brined wing pieces and pat dry. </step>
    <step num="3">Mix the flour with another ⅓ of the master spice mix. </step>
    <step num="4">Dredge the chicken wing pieces in the flour/spice mixture. Shake off any excess. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="5">Heat your oil to 325˚F (170˚C). </step>
    <step num="6">Fry the wings for 8-10 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 165˚F (74˚C). The wings will splatter so its a good idea to have a lid nearby! </step>
    <step num="7">Take the wings out and drain on a paper bag or paper towels. </step>
    <step num="8">Place the lard in a saucepan and sprinkle over the last ⅓ of your master spice mix. Once the lard is melted and warm, stir the mixture, and take it off the heat. Immediately baste your fried wings with the lard/spice mix and serve right away! </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
