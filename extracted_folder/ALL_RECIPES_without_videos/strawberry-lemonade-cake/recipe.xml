  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Grease three 8-inch (20 cm) tins with butter or cooking spray, then sprinkle with flour to cover all sides, shaking off any excess. Cut out three rounds of parchment paper to fit in the bottom of each tin. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs and sugar and use a hand mixer to beat until it has tripled in volume and is thick and pale yellow in color. </step>
    <step num="3">Continue blending and gradually add the olive oil. Add the vanilla extract, lemon zest, lemon juice, and milk, and mix until smooth. </step>
    <step num="4">Sift in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, gently incorporate into the liquid batter until just combined. Be careful not to over-mix. </step>
    <step num="5">Evenly divide the batter into the three baking tins. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 20-25 minutes, until cakes are lightly golden and fork comes out clean from the center. </step>
    <step num="7">Allow cakes to cool into the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a baking rack to cool completely. </step>
    <step num="8">Using a hand mixer, whisk the heavy whipping cream until soft peaks form. Add in the strawberry jam whisking together until fully incorporated and peaks are stiff. </step>
    <step num="9">Keep in the fridge until ready to use. </step>
    <step num="10">To assemble, start with a bottom layer of cake. Cover top with a generous amount of icing, followed by an even layer of sliced strawberries. Repeat with the remaining layers. </step>
    <step num="11">Finish the cake by icing the top and sides with icing, and garnishing the top with remaining strawberries. </step>
    <step num="12">Store in the fridge until ready to serve. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
