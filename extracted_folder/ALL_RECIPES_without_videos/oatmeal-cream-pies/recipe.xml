  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, mix the butter and brown sugar until well combined. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the molasses, vanilla, and eggs, and whisk thoroughly. </step>
    <step num="3">Sift in the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Mix until just combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the oats and mix until incorporated. Be careful not to overmix the batter or it might result in tougher cookies. </step>
    <step num="5">Using an ice cream scoop (or about 2 tablespoons), scoop out cookies onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving about 3 inches (8 cm) between each one. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 7-9 minutes. The cookies will still be very soft, so be sure to let them cool thoroughly. </step>
    <step num="7">While cooling, make the filling by beating the butter, milk, vanilla, and marshmallow fluff until well combined. </step>
    <step num="8">Once the cookies are cooled, put a spoonful of the filling on one cookie and sandwich with another. Repeat until all the sandwiches are made. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
