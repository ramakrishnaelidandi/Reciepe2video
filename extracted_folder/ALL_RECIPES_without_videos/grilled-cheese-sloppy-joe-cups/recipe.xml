  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Grease a 6-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="1">Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and sauté for 4-5 minutes, until the onion is translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the ground beef and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes. Drain any excess fat. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the mustard powder, pepper, and salt. Stir to combine, then add the tomato sauce, and cook for 5 minutes until liquid is cooked down. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the Worcestershire sauce and ketchup and cook for 10 minutes, until most of the liquid has evaporated. Remove the pan from the heat. </step>
    <step num="5">Slice the crusts off the bread. Quarter 2 of the slices to make small squares, leaving the remaining 6 slices whole. </step>
    <step num="6">Press the whole slices of bread into the cups of the greased muffin tin, and brush with melted butter. Add 1 tablespoon of shredded cheddar cheese to each cup, and top with a quartered piece of bread. Brush the bread with melted butter. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 10 minutes, until the cheese melted. </step>
    <step num="8">Scoop 2 tablespoons of sloppy joe mixture into each cup, and top with another tablespoon of cheddar. </step>
