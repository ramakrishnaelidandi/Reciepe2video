  <steps>
    <step num="0">To a large pot, add the 8 cups (1.9 L) of cold water and sprinkle in the agar agar powder. Whisk to combine. Let the agar dissolve in the water for about 5 minutes, whisking occasionally. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the sugar and whisk again to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">Place the pot over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 3 minutes, until all of the agar and sugar have dissolved, then remove from the heat. Do not keep over the heat for too long or the agar will denature! </step>
    <step num="3">Pour the agar mixture into a large glass or ceramic bowl with a smooth bottom. </step>
    <step num="4">Refrigerate overnight, or until set. </step>
    <step num="5">Make the brown sugar syrup: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the brown sugar and water. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Bring the syrup to a boil and remove the syrup from the heat, transfer to a liquid measuring cup, and refrigerate until cool and thickened, about 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="6">Invert the raindrop cake onto a large plate or cutting board. </step>
    <step num="7">Top with the roasted soybean flour and brown sugar syrup. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve immediately. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy!
