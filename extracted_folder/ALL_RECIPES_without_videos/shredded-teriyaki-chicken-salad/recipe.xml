  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the teriyaki sauce: In a liquid measuring cup or medium bowl, combine the brown sugar, soy sauce, lemon juice, sesame seeds, ginger, and garlic. Whisk to combine and dissolve the sugar. </step>
    <step num="1">Butterfly the chicken breasts, then place in a high-walled baking dish. Pour the teriyaki sauce over the chicken, reserving ½ cup (120 ml) of the sauce. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C). Line a baking sheet with foil. </step>
    <step num="3">Make the dressing: While whisking, slowly drizzle the olive oil into the reserved teriyaki sauce. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the marinated chicken breasts to the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160˚F (70˚C). Let cool for 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">In a medium bowl, use 2 forks to shred the chicken. Pour ¼ cup (60 ml) dressing over the chicken and toss to coat. </step>
