  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Grease 2 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pans with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="1">Heat the oil in a medium pan over medium heat. Add the celery, onion, and carrot and sauté until translucent, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, Dijon mustard, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, eggs, panko, milk, and salt (if using). Stir to combine, add the cooled sautéed veggies, and mix until homogeneous. </step>
    <step num="3">Divide the meatloaf between the prepared pans and spread the mixture evenly. </step>
    <step num="4">Bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Add 1 meatloaf layer to a serving plate. Spread a thin layer of tomato paste over the top. Add 2 cups (500 g) of mashed potatoes to the center and spread evenly. Top with the other meatloaf layer and spread with a layer of tomato paste and 2 cups (500 g) mashed potatoes. Use an offset spatula to cover the sides of the “cake” and spread the potatoes over the whole cake in an even layer. </step>
    <step num="6">Add another cup (250 g) of mashed potatoes to the top of the cake and spread evenly over the whole cake. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the remaining mashed potatoes to a piping bag fitted with a star tip. Pipe rosettes around the base and top of the cake. </step>
    <step num="8">Slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
