    <step num="5">Toss in the onion, carrot, celery, salt, pepper, and rosemary and sauté until the vegetables are completely tender, about 8 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Sprinkle in the garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. </step>
    <step num="7">Pour in the turkey leftovers and stir the mixture so that everything is evenly mixed. </step>
    <step num="8">Pour the mixture into a large bowl and let it cool about 5 minutes. </step>
