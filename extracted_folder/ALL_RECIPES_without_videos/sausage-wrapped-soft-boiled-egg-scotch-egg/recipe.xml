  <steps>
    <step num="0">Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add 5 eggs and boil for six minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Remove from heat and immediately transfer eggs to an ice water bath to cool (this will prevent the eggs from cooking further and will ensure a nice soft boiled egg) </step>
    <step num="2">Combine sausage, green onions, garlic, mustard, salt, and pepper. </step>
    <step num="3">Peel the cooled eggs and roll in flour. </step>
    <step num="4">Press out the sausage mixture into patties and wrap around the floured eggs. </step>
    <step num="5">Whisk the remaining 2 eggs together to form an egg wash. </step>
    <step num="6">Roll your sausage-wrapped egg in flour, then egg wash, and finish in the seasoned bread crumbs. Repeat for each egg. </step>
    <step num="7">Heat oil to 300˚F (150˚C) and fry each egg for about 3 minutes, until browned on all sides. </step>
    <step num="8">Transfer fried eggs to a baking tray and finish cooking in a preheated oven for 5 minutes at 200˚C (400˚F). </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
