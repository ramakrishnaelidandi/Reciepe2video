  <steps>
    <step num="0">Grease an 11-inch (25cm) round cake pan and line with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">Make the cream cheese filling: In a medium bowl, mix the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla until fully incorporated and smooth. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook the strawberry jam until reduced by half, about 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">Make the cake batter: In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt and whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the eggs, milk, melted butter, and vanilla and whisk until fully incorporated. Stir in the lemon zest and juice. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. </step>
    <step num="6">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer the reserved cream cheese filling and reduced jam to 2 piping bags fitted with round tips or zip-top bags with a corner cut off. </step>
    <step num="8">Starting in the center, pipe in a layer of jam in a spiral shape, moving towards the outside of the cake. Pipe a layer of cream cheese filling on top of the jam, following the swirl as closely as possible. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow cake to come to room temperature before removing from cake pan. </step>
    <step num="10">Make the lemon glaze: combine the powdered sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a medium bowl and whisk until a smooth glaze forms. </step>
    <step num="11">Remove the cooled cake from the pan and evenly pour over the glaze. </step>
    <step num="12">Allow the glaze to set before serving. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
