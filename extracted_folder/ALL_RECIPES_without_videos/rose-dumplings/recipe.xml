    <step num="2">Scoop a spoonful of filling onto the middle of each dumpling wrapper. Wet the edges of the wrappers and fold each wrapper over from top to bottom, ensuring that the edges are still overlapped, sealing tightly. Gently roll the dumplings from one end to the other, starting from the left side, creating a flower shape. Repeat with the remaining dumpling wrappers and fillings to create 8 rose dumplings in total. </step>
