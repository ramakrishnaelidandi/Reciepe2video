    <step num="0">Fill popsicle mold or muffin tin with a thick layer of Greek yogurt. </step>
    <step num="1">Add in strawberries and blueberries. You can either layer them or mix them around to distribute the fruit throughout. </step>
    <step num="2">Cover with top layer of Greek yogurt and use a spatula or a spoon to flatten the surface. </step>
    <step num="3">Place popsicle sticks in the center of the molds or muffin tin and place in the freezer for 2 hours or until frozen to your liking. If using a muffin tin, you might want to let the froyo freeze before placing in popsicle sticks so that they don’t fall over. </step>

    <step num="5">Enjoy! </step>
