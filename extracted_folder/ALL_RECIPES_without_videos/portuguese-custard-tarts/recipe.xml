    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 220°C (425°F). </step>
    <step num="1">In a small pan, place the sugar, water, and cinnamon stick. Simmer for 3 minutes and set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Combine milk and cream in a saucepan and place over a medium heat. Bring mixture to a boil, then remove from the heat and set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">To a large bowl, add the egg yolks, whole egg, vanilla extract, and corn flour. Whisk until fully combined and no lumps remain. </step>
    <step num="4">Temper the egg mixture by introducing the hot milk and cream in two 100 milliliter batches, then whisk. </step>
    <step num="5">Return mixture to the saucepan and place over a low-medium heat. Whisk continually until mixture thickens. Turn off heat. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove cinnamon stick from the syrup and slowly trickle into the custard, whisking continually. </step>
    <step num="7">Lightly flour a work surface and cut puff pastry into 12 equal pieces. </step>
    <step num="8">To a lightly greased muffin tin, push each piece of puff pastry down and up into the sides of the muffin holes until evenly distributed. </step>
    <step num="9">Pour custard into each muffin tin so each one is three quarters full. Bake for 16-20 minutes until golden and brown. </step>
    <step num="10">Serve warm with a dusting of icing sugar and a sprinkle of cinnamon. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
