  <steps>
    <step num="0">Slice the pork tenderloin into equal medallions, roughly ¼ inch (6 mm). </step>
    <step num="1">Pound the cutlets thin. Slice into slider size, roughly 3 square inches (7 ½ cm). </step>
    <step num="2">Mix flour, salt, and pepper in one bowl. Whisk two eggs in another bowl. Pour bread crumbs in the third bowl. </step>
    <step num="3">Dredge each cutlet in the flour mix, then egg mix, then breadcrumbs. </step>
    <step num="4">Heat up cooking oil in a large pan. Fry the cutlets until they are golden brown. </step>
    <step num="5">Set cutlets on a paper towel to remove excess grease. </step>
    <step num="6">Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add sliced onions and cook until starting to brown. Pour beer and stir occasionally. When the liquid is gone, the onions are ready. </step>
    <step num="7">Stack your sliders: pork, lemon juice, cheese, onion, sliced red cabbage, pork, and insert a toothpick to hold the slider together. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve with dressing of choice (optional). </step>
