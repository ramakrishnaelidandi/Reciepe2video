  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C) if making dressing. </step>
    <step num="1">Preheat the oven to 325˚F (160˚C) if making stuffing. </step>
    <step num="2">Crumble the cornbread and biscuits into a large bowl. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">Thinly slice the sage and set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until browned, 3-5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the onion and celery, and cook until softened, 5-7 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the sage, rosemary, and thyme, and cook until fragrant, 3-4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. </step>
    <step num="7">In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the butter and chicken stock. Melt the butter completely and bring to a boil. Add the heavy cream and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="8">Add the sausage mixture to the crumbled cornbread and biscuits, and mix to combine. Pour the chicken stock mixture, a bit at a time, over the bread mixture. Mix well. </step>
    <step num="9">If you are making dressing, transfer the mixture to a buttered 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking dish and cover with foil. Bake for 40 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for 10-15 minutes more, or until the top is lightly browned. Do not overbake. </step>
    <step num="10">If you are making stuffing, stuff the mixture into the cavity of a small turkey [12-14 pounds (5.5-.6.5 kilograms)]. Bake for 4-5 hours, or until the temperature of the stuffing reaches 165˚F (75˚C). </step>
    <step num="11">Serve warm with your favorite Thanksgiving dishes. </step>
