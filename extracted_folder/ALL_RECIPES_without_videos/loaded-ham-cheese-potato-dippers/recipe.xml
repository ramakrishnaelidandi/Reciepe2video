  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, mash the potatoes until there are no lumps. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the cheddar cheese, cream cheese, bacon, scallions, salt, pepper, and onion powder. </step>
    <step num="2">Mix until smooth. </step>
    <step num="3">Transfer the mixture to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Smooth out the top. </step>
    <step num="4">Lay a 1-inch (2-cm) square of cheddar cheese in the center of a slice of ham. Fold the edges of the ham over the cheese, making a tight parcel. Repeat with the remaining ham and cheese. </step>
    <step num="5">Press a ham-and-cheese square into the potato mixture, making sure to leave 1 inch (2-cm) of space on all sides. Repeat with the rest of the squares. </step>
    <step num="6">Push the potato mixture around to cover up and seal the tops of the ham squares, then smooth out again. </step>
    <step num="7">Freeze for 30 minutes, then slice the mixture into squares so each square has a ham square in the middle. </step>
    <step num="8">Place the flour, eggs, and panko into 3 separate medium bowls. </step>
    <step num="9">Dip a square into the flour, shaking off any excess. Dredge in the egg, then in the panko. Repeat with the remaining squares. </step>
    <step num="10">Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="11">Fry the potato squares two at a time until golden brown, about 4-5 minutes, then drain on paper towels. </step>
    <step num="12">Garnish the potato dippers with shredded Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley. Serve warm. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
