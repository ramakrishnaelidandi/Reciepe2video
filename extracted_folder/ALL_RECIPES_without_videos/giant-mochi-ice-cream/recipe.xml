  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make mochi. Combine glutinous rice flour, sugar, matcha, and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Whisk until smooth. Cover and microwave for 3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Mix well with using a wooden spatula. </step>
    <step num="2">Line a 10-inch (25 cm) bowl with plastic, set it aside, and sprinkle your tabletop with enough potato starch to avoid sticking. </step>
    <step num="3">Mix the mochi mixture and place on top of the starch. </step>
    <step num="4">Roll out the mochi larger than the bowl, about 15 inches (38 cm) across. </step>
    <step num="5">Lay mochi over the plastic-lined bowl. </step>
    <step num="6">Make the matcha ice cream. In a large bowl, add heavy cream, condensed milk, and matcha. Using a hand mixer, whip until thickened to soft peaks. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the ice cream mixture into the mochi-lined bowl. Take the excess mochi and lay it over the middle, encasing the ice cream. Cover with plastic. </step>
    <step num="8">Freeze at least 6 hours or overnight. </step>
    <step num="9">Bring the mochi ice cream to room temperature for 15-30 minutes before serving so mochi has time to soften. </step>
    <step num="10">Garnish with extra matcha on top, if you please. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
