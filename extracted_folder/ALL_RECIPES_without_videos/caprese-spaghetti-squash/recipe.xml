  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC). </step>
    <step num="1">With a sharp knife, slice the squash in half. If the squash is too tough, puncture in several places forming a dotted line around the squash. Microwave for 3-5 minutes to soften. Allow to cool before cutting in half. </step>
    <step num="2">Scoop out the seeds, brush with oil, and sprinkle with salt, and pepper. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a fork can easily pierce the skin. </step>
    <step num="3">In a pan over medium heat, add the oil, garlic, and onions, and sautè until onions are translucent. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the cherry tomatoes, salt, and pepper and simmer until they are cooked and begin to become softened. </step>
    <step num="5">Remove squash from the oven, with a fork pull at the edges to produce that stringy “spaghetti” quality. Add the squash to the tomato mixture and mix in the pan. </step>
    <step num="6">Add mixture back to the hollowed out spaghetti squash halves. Top with mini mozzarella balls ans basil. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake an additional 5-10 minutes, or until cheese melts. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve in the squash, and top with basil. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
