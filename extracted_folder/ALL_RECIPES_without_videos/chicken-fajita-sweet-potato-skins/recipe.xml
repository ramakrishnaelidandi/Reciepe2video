    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Using a fork, poke holes down one side of each sweet potato. Microwave for 3-5 minutes, or until softened. Let sweet potatoes cool before handling. </step>
    <step num="2">Cut the sweet potatoes in half and carve out the centers, leaving a small rim around the outside of each “boat.” </step>

    <step num="4">Mix the fajita seasoning ingredients together. </step>
    <step num="5">Drizzle in olive oil. Season the boats and veggies. </step>
    <step num="6">Add chicken breast on top of the veggies, drizzle in olive oil and add additional seasoning. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake 20-25 minutes, or until chicken reaches 165˚F (75˚C). Let cool for a few minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">Shred the chicken with 2 forks and mix together with the veggies. </step>
