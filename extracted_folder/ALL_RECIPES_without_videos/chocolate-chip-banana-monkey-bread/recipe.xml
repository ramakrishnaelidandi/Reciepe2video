  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Cut two bananas into half coins. </step>
    <step num="2">Cut one banana into coins and line the bottom of a greased bundt pan. </step>
    <step num="3">In a bowl mix sugar and cinnamon, set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">Cut each biscuit round in half and flatten into rounds. </step>
    <step num="5">Stuff each round with one piece of the halved banana coins and chocolate chips. Close the round together by pinching at the seam and roll into a ball in your hands. </step>
    <step num="6">Place the balls in the cinnamon sugar mix and gently toss to coat. Place half the balls in the pan. </step>
    <step num="7">In a saucepan over medium heat melt the butter and brown sugar until one, stirring occasionally. Set aside to cool. </step>
    <step num="8">Pour half of the glaze on top. </step>
    <step num="9">Sprinkle a handful of chocolate chips over top. Then place rest of the balls on top followed by the rest of the glaze. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake for 40-50 minutes until the crust is a deep dark brown on top. (If the top is browning too much you can cover it with aluminum foil.) </step>
    <step num="11">Remove from oven and allow it to cool or about 15-30 minutes before turning it over onto a plate. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
