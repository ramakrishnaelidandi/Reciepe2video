  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350F˚ (180C˚). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, add the short ribs, all vegetables, herbs and black pepper to taste for the marinade. Add the wine to cover. </step>
    <step num="2">Marinate at least 6 hours in the fridge. </step>
    <step num="3">Remove the meat from the marinade and pat dry with a towel or paper towel. </step>
    <step num="4">Strain the veggies from the wine. Reserve both the wine and veggies for later. </step>
    <step num="5">Season the meat with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Coat each side with flour and set aside. </step>
    <step num="6">In a large ovenproof pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat on the stovetop. </step>
    <step num="7">When the oil begins smoking, carefully slip ribs into the pot and sear until well-browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer ribs to plate. </step>
    <step num="8">In the same pot, sauté the veggies from the marinade until lightly caramelized and browned, 5 to 7 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Add the wine in the pot, stirring to deglaze. Add tomato paste and stir to dissolve. Bring the liquid to a boil so the alcohol from the wine evaporates. </step>
    <step num="10">Add beef broth and bring it back to a boil. Add the ribs back to your pot. Spoon the liquid over the ribs to coat them. </step>
    <step num="11">Cover the pot and transfer to the middle rack of your oven. </step>
    <step num="12">Bake until meat is tender enough to be pierced easily with fork, about 2½ hours, opening the oven every 30 minutes and carefully skimming the fat from surface. </step>
    <step num="13">Serve with mashed potatoes, or another side of your choice, and garnish with chopped parsley on top. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
