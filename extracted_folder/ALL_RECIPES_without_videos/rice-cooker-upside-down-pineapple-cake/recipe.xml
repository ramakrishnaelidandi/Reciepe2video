    <step num="0">In a large bowl, use a spatula to mix the sugar and cream cheese until well-combined. Whisk in the eggs until there are no lumps remaining. </step>
    <step num="1">Stir in the pineapple juice, melted butter, and pancake mix until the batter is thick and smooth. </step>
    <step num="2">Make the caramel sauce: in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter, then add the brown sugar. Stir rapidly for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat once mixture starts to boil and thicken. </step>
    <step num="3">Pour the caramel sauce into the bottom of a 1-liter rice cooker bowl insert. </step>
    <step num="4">Place one pineapple slice in the middle of the rice cooker bowl, then arrange the other slices in a ring around it. Place one maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple slice. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour the cake batter over the pineapple slices and shake to smooth out the top of the batter. </step>
    <step num="6">Cook for 60 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Remove the bowl insert from the rice cooker and invert the cake onto a plate. </step>
    <step num="8">Slice and serve, topped with vanilla ice cream if desired. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
