  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">Cut off the top third of pumpkin. Remove the pumpkin seeds and pulp (reserve the seeds for another use). </step>
    <step num="2">Drizzle the inside of the pumpkin with 1 tablespoon of olive and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. </step>
    <step num="3">Place the pumpkin on the baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes until slightly softened. </step>
    <step num="4">While the pumpkin is baking, make the chili: Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet with a lid over medium heat, until shimmering. Add the onion and garlic, and sauté for 2 minutes, until translucent. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the ground beef and cook until browned, 7-10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the kidney beans, tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, pepper, chili powder, paprika, cinnamon, cumin, and water, and stir to combine. Cook for 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Reduce the heat to low, add the cream cheese and 1 cup of Monterey Jack, and stir until incorporated. Remove from the heat. </step>
    <step num="8">Once the pumpkin is done baking, remove from the oven and turn the oven to broil. </step>
    <step num="9">Carefully pour the chili cheese dip into the pumpkin. Sprinkle the remaining cup of Monterey Jack cheese on top, all the way to the edge of the pumpkin. </step>
    <step num="10">Return to the oven and broil for 2-4 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown. Watch carefully to make sure it doesn’t burn. </step>
