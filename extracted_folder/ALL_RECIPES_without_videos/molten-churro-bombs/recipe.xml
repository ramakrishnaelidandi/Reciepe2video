  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the water, butter, 2 tablespoons sugar, and the salt, and bring to a boil. </step>
    <step num="1">As soon as the mixture begins to boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the flour. Using a wooden spoon, stir until the dough comes together to form a ball, about 1 minute. </step>
    <step num="2">Remove the pan from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes before proceeding to avoid accidentally cooking the eggs. </step>
    <step num="3">Mix in the eggs, 1 at a time, fully incorporating each egg before adding the next. Then add the vanilla. </step>
    <step num="4">Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="5">Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a closed star tip. </step>
    <step num="6">Pipe 18 1½-inch (3 cm) spiral rounds onto the baking sheet. Top each with a milk chocolate truffle. Pipe the dough in a spiral to cover the truffles, being careful to completely seal the chocolate. Immediately transfer the tray to the freezer and freeze for 1 hour, until solid. </step>
    <step num="7">Heat the oil in a deep pot until it reaches 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="8">Fry in batches of 4 until nicely browned, about 3 minutes, turning so they fry evenly. Drain on a cooling rack, or paper towel-lined plate and dab off any excess oil. </step>
    <step num="9">Combine the remaining ½ cup sugar (100 G) and the cinnamon in a small bowl. Roll the warm churro bombs in the mixture to coat. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
