    <step num="0">In a bowl, add the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda, and whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="1">In a bowl or measuring cup, whisk the buttermilk, eggs, and melted butter until smooth. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the buttermilk mixture to the dry ingredients, gently incorporating with a spatula. Make sure not to overmix, as that will result in dense pancakes. </step>
