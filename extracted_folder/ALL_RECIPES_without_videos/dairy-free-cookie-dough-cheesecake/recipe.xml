  <steps>
    <step num="0">The night before you intend to make the “cheesecake,” place the cashews in a medium bowl and cover with water. Soak overnight. </step>
    <step num="1">To make the crust, add the walnuts, almonds, dates, coconut, vanilla extract, water, and salt to a food processor or blender and pulse until sticky mounds begin to form. </step>
    <step num="2">Press the crust into a 7-inch (18 cm) springform pan lined with parchment paper. Set aside at room temperature. </step>
    <step num="3">To make the cookie dough, add the flour, coconut oil, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and salt to a medium bowl. Stir until a soft dough forms. </step>
    <step num="4">Fold in the chocolate chunks, then cover and chill in the refrigerator while you make the filling. </step>
    <step num="5">Drain the cashews and add to a food processor, along with the maple syrup, coconut oil, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Blend until completely smooth, scraping down the sides as needed. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove the cookie dough from the refrigerator and use your hands to form ½-inch (1 cm) cookie dough balls. Sprinkle a handful of cookie dough balls over the crust, saving some for later. </step>
    <step num="7">Pour the cashew filling gently and evenly over the cookie dough balls and crust. Gently spread the mixture to cover all of the cookie dough balls. </step>
    <step num="8">Top with the remaining cookie dough balls, then cover and freeze for about 2 hours to set. Then, transfer to the refrigerator until ready to serve. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
