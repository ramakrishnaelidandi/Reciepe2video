    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>

    <step num="5">Arrange 5 potatoes around the sides of a muffin cup, overlapping slightly. Place 1 slice on the bottom to create a flower. Repeat with the remaining potato slices. Sprinkle shredded cheese over the potato cups. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Remove the potato cups from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 300°F (150°C). </step>
