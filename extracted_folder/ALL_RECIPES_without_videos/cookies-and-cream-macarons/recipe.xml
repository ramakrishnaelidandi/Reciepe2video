  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 285ºF (140ºC). </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy. </step>
    <step num="2">Keep beating and slowly add sugar until stiff peaks form. </step>
    <step num="3">Sift powdered sugar, cookie crumbs, almond flour, and cocoa powder over the egg whites. </step>
    <step num="4">Fold the dry mixture into the egg whites completely, but make sure to not overmix or the macarons will not rise. </step>
    <step num="5">Once the batter reaches a lava-like consistency, add the food coloring. Mix until just combined, without over mixing. </step>
    <step num="6">Place the mixture into a piping bag or zip-top bag. Cut of the tip to pipe. </step>
    <step num="7">Pipe 1½-inch (4 cm) dollops onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Tip: take a little batter to “glue” down the edges of the parchment paper so it stays put. </step>
    <step num="8">Let the cookies rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to an hour, until they are no longer wet to the touch and a skin forms on top. </step>
    <step num="9">While resting, make the filling by mixing the butter, powdered sugar, cookie cream filling, vanilla, and milk in a bowl until smooth. </step>
    <step num="10">Transfer to a piping bag and set aside until ready to fill. </step>
    <step num="11">When the cookies are dry to the touch, bake for 15-18 minutes until they have risen. </step>
    <step num="12">Let rest for 10 minutes before filling. </step>
    <step num="13">To fill, pipe about about a tablespoon of the buttercream onto one macaron and place another on top. </step>
    <step num="14">Macarons are best kept refrigerated until serving. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
