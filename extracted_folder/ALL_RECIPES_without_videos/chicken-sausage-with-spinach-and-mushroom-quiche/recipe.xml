  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Cook sausage over medium-high until lightly browned, about 5-7 minutes, being sure to break up the meat into a fine mince. </step>
    <step num="2">Remove cooked sausage from pan and wipe away excess fat with a paper towel. </step>
    <step num="3">Add onion and sauté until softened and translucent, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add mushrooms, salt, and pepper and continue to cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Add chopped spinach and cook until wilted and no extra liquid has accumulated in the bottom of the pan. </step>
    <step num="5">NOTE: Do your best to use the excessive moisture of the spinach and mushrooms to deglaze the bottom of the pan, scraping away any browned bits from cooking the sausage earlier. </step>
    <step num="6">Once cooked, remove the spinach and mushroom mixture from the pan and combine it with the reserved cooked sausage. Stir to mix evenly. </step>
    <step num="7">Combine eggs and milk. Lightly whisk until just combined. </step>
    <step num="8">Add sausage and spinach mixture to the bottom of a prepared 9-inch (23cm) pie crust, making sure to spread it evenly. </step>
    <step num="9">Pour in beaten eggs to fill the rest of the pie crust and top with a generous sprinkle of parmesan cheese. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake at 350˚F (180˚C) for 25 minutes or until the eggs are set and the top is lightly browned. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
