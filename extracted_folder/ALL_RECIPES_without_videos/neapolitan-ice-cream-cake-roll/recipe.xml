  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and grease with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until pale and foamy, about 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the sugar, oil, and vanilla. Whisk again until incorporated. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. </step>
    <step num="4">Mix with a spatula until combined. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour the batter onto the baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 12 minutes until the cake is set. </step>
    <step num="7">Lay out a kitchen towel and sprinkle with cocoa powder. </step>
    <step num="8">Once the cake is done, invert it onto the towel, remove the parchment, and lift the towel to roll the cake into a log. The towel will wrap into the cake. </step>
    <step num="9">Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour to cool. </step>
    <step num="10">Place the cake on the counter and unroll. </step>
    <step num="11">Place ice cream scoops on the cake in an even line, starting with chocolate, then the strawberry and vanilla. </step>
    <step num="12">Smooth each line of ice cream out, being careful not to mix the flavors. </step>
    <step num="13">Tightly roll the cake back up, this time without the towel. </step>
    <step num="14">Freeze the cake for at least 3 hours, or overnight. </step>
    <step num="15">Place the chocolate chips in a medium bowl. </step>
    <step num="16">Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and stir until melted and smooth. </step>
    <step num="17">Place the cake on a rack set over a baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="18">Pour the ganache over the cake in an even layer. </step>
    <step num="19">Place cake in the freezer for 30 minutes, or until the ganache is set. </step>
    <step num="20">Enjoy! </step>
