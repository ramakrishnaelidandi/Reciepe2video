  <steps>
    <step num="0">Whizz together the flour and water in a food processor for a minute or so until it clumps together to form a single ball. You might need to add a little bit more water or flour to get the consistency right. (Dough should be soft, but not sticky!) </step>
    <step num="1">Preheat the grill (broiler) on high. </step>
    <step num="2">On a floured surface, roll out the dough to about 1 cm (½ inch) thick. </step>
    <step num="3">Place pizza dough onto a well-oiled, oven-safe frying pan on high heat. </step>
    <step num="4">While the bottom is cooking on the hob, top the pizza with the sauce, cheese, pepperoni herbs and whatever else you like. (Try your best to not over-top it or else it can fall apart or get soggy.) </step>
    <step num="5">Continue cooking on high until the edges of the crust start browning and crisping. </step>
    <step num="6">Place the pan under the grill and cook the toppings until the cheese is bubbly and browning. Slice. </step>
    <step num="7">If you’re quick, you can actually have this from-scratch pizza on your plate (and in you mouth) quicker than it takes to cook a pre-made frozen pizza. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
