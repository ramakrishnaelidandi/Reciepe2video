  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, mix the ground beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, Parmesan, parsley, garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano. </step>
    <step num="2">Roll the mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs. </step>
    <step num="3">In a medium cast iron or nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. </step>
    <step num="4">Working in batches cook the meatballs until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="5">On a sheet of parchment paper, press the pizza dough into a large circle, about 12 inches (30-cm) in diameter. </step>
    <step num="6">Cut 8 evenly spaced 2-inch (5-cm) slits on the edge of the dough. </step>
    <step num="7">Place one meatball on the edge of the dough between 2 slits. Pull the corners of the dough around the meatball and press into the dough, sealing the meatball in a dough pocket. Repeat with the remaining meatballs. </step>
    <step num="8">With the help of a friend, transfer the pizza and parchment to a baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="9">Spoon marinara sauce into the middle of the pizza and spread evenly. </step>
    <step num="10">Sprinkle mozzarella over the sauce, or add your favorite pizza toppings! Brush the dough around the meatballs with olive oil. </step>
    <step num="11">Bake for 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and the dough is golden and just cooked through. </step>
    <step num="12">Slice with a pizza cutter and serve. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
