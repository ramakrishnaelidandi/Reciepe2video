  <steps>
    <step num="0">Cut oranges in half and juice. </step>
    <step num="1">Pour red wine in a large pot. Add the orange juice through a sieve to get rid of pulp. </step>
    <step num="2">Add cider, cloves and half the cinnamon sticks and bring to a simmer, but do not boil. </step>
    <step num="3">Cut apple in ⅓ - ½ inch (1 cm) slices, leaving the peel on and the star in the middle intact. Put the center slices with a star aside and add the rest of the ends to the punch. </step>
    <step num="4">To serve, pour punch in a heat resistant glass. </step>
    <step num="5">Take the center slices with the inner star shape and clean the holes of the seeds and tough lining, making sure to keep the star shape intact. </step>
    <step num="6">Carefully place the apple slice on the punch, so it floats on top. </step>
    <step num="7">Pour a little bit of the rum in a glass, heat-safe dish. Have another glass nearby to hold the spoon you will use to move the sugar to the apple. </step>
    <step num="8">Soak sugar cube in rum and place it over the star in the glass. </step>
    <step num="9">Carefully, with a lighter, set sugar cube on fire until you see the sugar bubbling and a blue flame. </step>
    <step num="10">If necessary, carefully add small amounts of rum on the sugar cube with a spoon to keep it burning until the sugar is melted. </step>
    <step num="11">Stir with a cinnamon stick and enjoy immediately while it is still hot. If not sweet enough, repeat sugar cube flaming step or add more sugar to the hot drink. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
