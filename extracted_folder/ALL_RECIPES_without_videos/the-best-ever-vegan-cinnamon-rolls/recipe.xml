  <steps>
    <step num="0">Generously rub two disposable foil pie pans with vegan butter. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, whisk together the almond milk, melted butter, and sugar. The mixture should be just warm, registering between 100-110˚F (37-43˚C). If it is hotter, allow to cool slightly. </step>
    <step num="2">Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the warm mixture and let set for 1 minute. </step>
    <step num="3">Add 5 cups flour and 1 teaspoon of salt to the milk mixture and mix with a wooden spoon until just combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Cover the bowl with a towel or plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise for 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="5">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="6">After 1 hour, the dough should have nearly doubled in size. </step>
    <step num="7">Remove the towel and add an additional ½ cup (95g) of flour and salt. Stir well, then turn out onto a well-floured surface. </step>
    <step num="8">Knead the dough lightly, adding additional flour as necessary, until the dough just loses its stickiness and does not stick to the surface. </step>
    <step num="9">Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about ½-inch (1 cm) thick. Fix corners to make sure they are sharp and even. </step>
    <step num="10">Spread the softened vegan butter evenly over the dough. </step>
    <step num="11">Sprinkle evenly with brown sugar and cinnamon. </step>
    <step num="12">Roll up the dough, forming a log, and pinch the seam closed. Place seam-side down. Trim off any unevenness on either end. </step>
    <step num="13">Cut the log in half, then divide each half into 7 evenly sized pieces. About 1½ inches (8 cm) thick each. </step>
    <step num="14">Place 7 cinnamon rolls in each cake pan, one in the center, six around the sides. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="15">To prepare the frosting. In a medium-size mixing bowl, whisk together powdered sugar, almond milk, and vanilla until smooth. </step>
    <step num="16">Remove plastic wrap. Bake the cinnamon rolls in a preheated oven at 350˚F (180˚C) for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="17">While still warm, drizzle evenly with frosting. </step>
    <step num="18">Enjoy! </step>
