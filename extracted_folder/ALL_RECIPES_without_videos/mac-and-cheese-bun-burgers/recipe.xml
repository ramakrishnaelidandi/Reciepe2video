  <steps>
    <step num="0">Prepare macaroni according to package directions. Drain the macaroni in a colander and return to the pot. </step>
    <step num="1">Add butter, cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, American cheese, milk, salt, mustard powder, cayenne to the pot. Turn heat up to medium-low and stir until cheeses are melted and all ingredients are well combined. </step>
    <step num="2">Remove the pot from the heat and pour onto a parchment paper-lined sheet tray. Spread evenly with a spatula, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Once cooled, use a ring mold or rounded container roughly 4-inches (10 cm) in diameter to cut out 6-8 “buns.” </step>
    <step num="4">Place flour, eggs, and bread crumbs in three separate bowls. </step>
    <step num="5">Dip each macaroni bun in flour, then egg, and finally bread crumbs, coating evenly. </step>
    <step num="6">Preheat vegetable oil to 350°F (175°C). </step>
    <step num="7">Place the macaroni buns gently in oil and fry 3-4 minutes, until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel-lined plate. </step>
    <step num="8">Season hamburger patties liberally with salt and pepper. In a cast-iron skillet over high heat, sear patties to desired doneness, flipping halfway through. </step>
    <step num="9">Place burger between two mac and cheese buns and top with sliced onions and tomatoes. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
