  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, heavy cream, 1 teaspoon of salt, and the ricotta. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Heat a 12-inch (30 cm) cast-iron or stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until crisp, 3-5 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the bacon from the pan to a paper towel-lined plate, leaving the rendered bacon fat in the pan. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the onion to the pan and cook until caramelized, 8-10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the zucchini and sauté until starting to soften, 2-3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the corn and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the zucchini softens further but is still bright green. Season with the remaining teaspoon of salt and the pepper. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour the egg mixture over the vegetables, then top with the bacon. </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, until the top is puffed and the eggs are cooked through. </step>
    <step num="8">Garnish with parsley, then serve directly from the skillet. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
