  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, combine 1 cup rice wine (235 ml), ¼ cup (60 ml) of soy sauce, and cubed chicken thighs. Stir and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to an hour. </step>
    <step num="1">In a separate large bowl, combine 1 cup of flour (140 g) and 1 tablespoon of salt. </step>
    <step num="2">Remove chicken from wine/soy marinade and place in flour mixture. Mix thoroughly, until all the chicken pieces are coated. </step>
    <step num="3">Fill a dutch oven or large pot at least 2 inches (5 cm) deep with vegetable oil. Heat oil to 365˚F (185˚C). Place chicken pieces in frying oil, stirring occasionally. Fry until they are golden brown, roughly 4-5 minutes. Remove chicken from oil and set aside to drain on paper towels or a wire rack. </step>
    <step num="4">In a large skillet, bring one tablespoon of vegetable oil to medium-high heat. Add garlic and ginger, stirring frequently for one minute. </step>
    <step num="5">Add dried chili pods. Continue stirring for 30 seconds before adding rice wine, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, and sugar. Stir occasionally until mixture is bubbling. </step>
