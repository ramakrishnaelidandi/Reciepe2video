  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F (175C). </step>
    <step num="1">Spray a 9x9 inch (23x23cm) baking pan with cooking spray. </step>
    <step num="2">Prepare and pour the chocolate cake batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large bowl, mix together cream cheese and peanut butter until smooth. </step>
    <step num="4">Add condensed milk, whisking until there are no large lumps. </step>
    <step num="5">Gradually whisk in the milk, until smooth. </step>
    <step num="6">Using the back of a wooden spoon, poke 4 rows of 4 holes in the cake, making 16 holes total. </step>
    <step num="7">Pour the peanut butter mixture over the cake and set until the cake has absorbed as much of the mixture as it can. Some of the mixture will still stay on top, which is okay. </step>
    <step num="8">Freeze cake for 30 minutes, to slightly solidify the topping. </step>
    <step num="9">Spread the whipped topping evenly over the chilled cake. </step>
    <step num="10">Chill the cake anywhere from 3 hours to overnight. </step>
    <step num="11">Slice, and garnish with peanut butter cups. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
