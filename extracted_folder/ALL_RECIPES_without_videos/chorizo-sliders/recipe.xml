  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a pan over medium heat, lightly brown the chorizo for about 5-7 minutes to cook out excess fat (it does not have to be cooked through). </step>
    <step num="2">Remove the chorizo from heat and drain any excess oil. </step>
    <step num="3">In a medium bowl, mix the chorizo, breadcrumbs, half of stock, poblano peppers, carrots, half of onions, Cotija cheese, egg, egg yolk, cilantro, parsley, salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="4">Use your hands to roll the mixture into approximately 12-16 golf ball-sized meatballs. </step>
    <step num="5">Transfer the meatballs to a baking sheet and bake for about 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">In a dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat, add oil and sauté remaining onions and garlic until fragrant and translucent, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the can of tomatoes and remaining stock. Tip: Adding the stock into the empty can will ensure you don’t waste any tomatoes that may be left behind. </step>
    <step num="8">Add the chipotles in adobo and simmer about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Add the meatballs, cover with lid slightly ajar, and simmer for about 30 minutes until the meatballs are cooked through. </step>
    <step num="10">While simmering, combine mayonnaise, jalapeño sauce, mint, salt, and pepper in a blender or food processor. Pulse until combined. </step>
    <step num="11">Cut the slider buns in half. Spread the Jalapeño Aioli on the top half. </step>
    <step num="12">Remove meatballs from skillet and place one on the bottom halves of each roll, then drizzle with some of the tomato sauce and sprinkle cheese on top. </step>
    <step num="13">Sandwich the tops onto the meatballs and serve immediately. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
