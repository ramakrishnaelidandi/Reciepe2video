  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Over a long sheet of saran wrap, lay 8 of the bacon strips down back to back. Lifting up every other strip, fold about 1-inch (2 cm) the bacon back on itself. Lay another slice of bacon perpendicular to the strips and fold the flaps back over the horizontal strip of bacon. Repeat with the rest of the bacon until a tight weave has formed. Set aside in the fridge. </step>
    <step num="2">In a medium saucepan, add the butter and garlic over medium heat, cooking until aromatic, about 30 seconds. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the cream, and bring to a boil. </step>
    <step num="4">Add in the Parmesan, parsley, salt, and pepper, stirring constantly until the cheese has melted and there are no lumps remaining. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour half of the mixture over the shredded chicken, reserving the other half to use a sauce in the end. </step>
    <step num="6">Mix the chicken with the sauce until thoroughly combined. </step>
    <step num="7">On a separate sheet of saran wrap, lay down the lasagna noodles, overlapping them slightly. </step>
    <step num="8">Spread the chicken mixture over the noodles, making sure that you leave about a 1-cm (½ inch) gap at the bottom so the noodles have room to roll on themselves. </step>
    <step num="9">Place the cheese slices evenly across the chicken, then press the spinach into a row centered between the cheese slices. </step>
    <step num="10">While one hand keeps the spinach flat, use the other hand to lift the saran wrap up and over, causing the noodles to roll on themselves. Make sure to roll tightly until the entire thing has come together into a neat rolled bundle. </step>
    <step num="11">Transfer the lasagna roll to the bottom of the bacon weave, and repeat the saran wrap rolling process until the bacon has tightly and completely wrapped the lasagna roll. </step>
    <step num="12">Unwrap and transfer to a baking tray. </step>
    <step num="13">Bake for about 25 minutes until the bacon is starting to get crispy but not too dark. </step>
    <step num="14">Cool for about 15 minutes, then transfer the roll to a cutting board. </step>
    <step num="15">Slice generous 1-inch (2 cm) thick portions, then serve with the remaining alfredo sauce. </step>
    <step num="16">Enjoy! </step>
