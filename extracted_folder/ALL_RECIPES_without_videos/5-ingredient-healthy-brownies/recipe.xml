    <step num="1">In a small microwave-safe bowl, microwave the chocolate in 15 to 30-second intervals, stirring occasionally, until completely melted. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">While the chocolate cools a bit, beat the eggs thoroughly with a whisk until foamy and pale. </step>
    <step num="3">Pour in the honey and melted chocolate and whisk until fully combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Sprinkle in the whole wheat flour and salt. Fold the batter together with a spatula just until the flour disappears. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour the batter into a greased 8x8-inch (20x20 cm) baking tin and spread the top into an even layer. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 15 minutes, until the batter has just begun to set. </step>
