  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large pot at medium-high heat, add the olive oil and carrots to the pot. Cook the carrots for about 10 minutes until they start to brown slightly. </step>
    <step num="1">Next add the chopped onion, red bell pepper, celery, garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper to the pot and cook until the vegetables are caramelized and tender. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the tomato paste, stir it into the vegetables, and allow the tomato paste to brown deeply. It should be very aromatic before moving forward. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the canned tomatoes and water, bring the sauce to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer. Simmer the sauce for at least 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the sauce to a blender in batches or use an immersion blender to puree the sauce to your desired consistency. </step>
    <step num="5">Let the sauce cool completely and then pour the sauce into freezer-safe bags. Place the bags into a leak-proof container/tray, and freeze for up to one month. </step>
    <step num="6">Reheat the frozen sauce with ½ cup of water in a pot until it comes to a boil and then use as desired. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
