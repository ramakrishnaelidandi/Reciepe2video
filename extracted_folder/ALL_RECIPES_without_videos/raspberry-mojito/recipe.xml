  <steps>
    <step num="0">Throw the lime wedges, raspberries, mint, and sugar into a glass and then, using a muddler or wooden spoon, press down on the ingredients to mush them all together and get all of the juice out of the lime wedges. </step>
    <step num="1">Add ice and pour in rum (you can just eyeball the amount, if you don’t have something handy to measure) and then top the glass off with club soda. </step>
    <step num="2">If you want it a little more or less sweet, you can always add slightly more or slightly less sugar. It’s also delicious with less rum, or no rum at all. </step>
    <step num="3">Stir well and top with fresh mint. </step>
    <step num="4">Enjoy! </step>
