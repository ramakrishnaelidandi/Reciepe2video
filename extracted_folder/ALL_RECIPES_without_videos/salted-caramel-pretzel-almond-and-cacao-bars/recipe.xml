  <steps>
    <step num="0">Line a square, loose-bottom 20-cm (8-in) baking tray with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">First make the almond biscuit layer: blend all of the ingredients except the ground almonds in the blender until the nuts and coconut are finely chopped. Add the ground almonds then pulse until fully incorporated. The mixture should be sticky. </step>
    <step num="2">Press the almond mixture into the base of the baking tray, making sure it’s an even layer all over. </step>
    <step num="3">Pop the tray into the freezer and get on with the caramel layer. </step>
    <step num="4">Rinse out the blender. Blend all of the ingredients in the blender until the mixture is as smooth as possible. </step>
    <step num="5">Remove the tray from the freezer and spread the caramel layer over the top evenly. Pop the tray back into the freezer to set for around 2 hours. </step>
    <step num="6">After the 2 hours, remove the tray from the freezer and place the toppings on. </step>
    <step num="7">Carefully remove the bars from the tin, then cut it into 12-14 bars. Run your knife under hot water between each cut to make it easier. </step>
    <step num="8">Place the bars onto a baking tray and back into the freezer while you make the coating. </step>
    <step num="9">Mix the chocolate coating ingredients together in a small mixing bowl until smooth. </step>
    <step num="10">Remove the bars from the freezer and drizzle the coating over the top of each bar. Top each bar with a couple of pretzels or a sprinkling of flaked almonds. Serve straight away or store in the freezer for up to 2 months. Serve straight from the freezer. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
