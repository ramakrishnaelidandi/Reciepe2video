  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Slice the steak in half lengthwise then season all of the sides with the salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="2">Heat oil in a pan over extremely high heat until oil is slightly smoking. </step>
    <step num="3">Sear the steak for about one minute, then flip. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the butter, rosemary, and garlic, swirling the pan so that the butter melts. Tilt the pan towards you, and using a large spoon, constantly scoop the melted butter on top of the steak, basting it for about one minute. </step>
    <step num="5">NOTE: This helps cook the top of the steak faster and provide more flavor. </step>
    <step num="6">Sear the sides of the steak for about 30 seconds, then remove it from heat completely. Repeat with the other strip of steak. </step>
    <step num="7">Cut the ends off the baguette and remove the insides using a knife. </step>
    <step num="8">Once the steaks are completely cool, stuff the hollowed out baguettes with the steak. Place the baguettes on a baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="9">In a medium bowl, combine the melted butter, garlic, Parmesan, and parsley, stirring until evenly combined. Spread the garlic butter evenly on top of the steak-stuffed baguettes. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake for 15–20 minutes, depending on how you like your steak. </step>
    <step num="11">Slice into 1 in (3 cm) bites. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
