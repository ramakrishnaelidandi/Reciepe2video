  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 275˚F (135˚C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, salt, and baker’s ammonia. </step>
    <step num="2">In a separate medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar with an electric hand mixer on low speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the vanilla and continue beating until fully combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="5">Roll about 1 ounce of dough at a time in your hands to make walnut-sized balls. They will be small, about ½ inch (1 ¼ cm) wide. Place the balls of dough on the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch (2 ½ cm) of space between each cookie. Using a flat-bottomed measuring cup, gently press down on the cookies to flatten. </step>
    <step num="6">Top each cookie with 3 chocolate chips, a single almond, or raisins. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake the cookies for 30 minutes, or until the bottoms are light golden brown and the edges are crispy. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
