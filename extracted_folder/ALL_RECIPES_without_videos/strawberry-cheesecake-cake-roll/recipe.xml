  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a bowl, whisk the eggs until pale yellow, about 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Add in the 1½ cups (300 grams) sugar and whisk again until combined. </step>
    <step num="3">Mix in oil, baking powder, salt, and vanilla. </step>
    <step num="4">Add in flour, and fold until smooth and combined. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour the batter on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and spread evenly. Gently tap the baking sheet on the counter to release any air bubbles. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until cooked through. </step>
    <step num="7">Lay out a kitchen towel and sprinkle with powdered sugar. </step>
    <step num="8">Once the cake is done, invert it onto the towel and lift the towel to roll the cake into a log. The towel will wrap into the cake. </step>
    <step num="9">Refrigerate cake for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="10">In a bowl, mix the cream cheese, remaining sugar, and vanilla. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="11">Place the cake on the counter and unroll. </step>
    <step num="12">Spread the cream cheese mixture in an even layer over the cake and top with sliced strawberries. </step>
    <step num="13">Tightly roll the cake bake up, this time just using the towel as a guide. </step>
    <step num="14">Top with powdered sugar. </step>
    <step num="15">Slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="16">Enjoy! </step>
