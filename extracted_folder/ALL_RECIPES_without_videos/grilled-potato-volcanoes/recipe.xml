  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the grill to 400˚F/200˚C. </step>
    <step num="1">Thoroughly scrub the potatoes until they are clean and poke a few holes around the potato to vent. </step>
    <step num="2">Wrap in aluminium foil and place on the grill to cook for 20 minutes over direct heat. </step>
    <step num="3">In the meantime, mix half of the cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and green onions until well-combined. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">Remove the potatoes from the grill and let them rest until they are cool enough to handle. </step>
    <step num="5">Unwrap the potato and cut off the ends so that it will stand up. </step>
    <step num="6">Using a melon baller or a spoon, carve out the center of the potato, being careful not to make the walls too thin, and to leave a bit of thickness at the bottom as well. </step>
    <step num="7">Fill the potato with the cheese mixture and wrap 2 slices of bacon around the potato. Secure the bacon with toothpicks if necessary. </step>
    <step num="8">Lower the grill temperature to about 350˚F/175˚C and place potatoes over indirect heat on the grill for 30 minutes with the lid closed. </step>
    <step num="9">Top with the remaining cheddar cheese and cook for another 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="10">Garnish with a dollop of sour cream and some green onions. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
