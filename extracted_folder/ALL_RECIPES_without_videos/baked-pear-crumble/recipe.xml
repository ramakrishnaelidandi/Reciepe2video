  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a food processor, combine the oats, hazelnuts, walnuts, shredded coconut, cherries, flax seeds, cinnamon, and salt. Pulse until finely ground. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the coconut oil, honey, and vanilla, and pulse until just combined. The mixture should hold together when squeezed between your fingers. </step>
    <step num="3">Cut the pears in half lengthwise. Using a tablespoon, scoop out the cores. With a paring knife, cut a “v” shape around the edges of the stem, cutting downward on an angle. Remove the stems. </step>
    <step num="4">Set the pears in a baking dish, cut-side up. Fill each with ¼ cup (30 grams) of the crumble topping, pressing lightly into the pears. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the pears are tender when pierced with a paring knife. </step>
    <step num="6">Serve immediately, topped with whipped topping and a drizzle of honey, if desired. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
