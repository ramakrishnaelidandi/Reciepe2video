  <steps>
    <step num="0">Season the meat on all sides with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="1">Heat a large heavy pot with a lid over medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and brown the meat in batches until a crust forms, turning to ensure even color on all sides. </step>
    <step num="2">Once one batch is done, set aside in a bowl or plate with a lip, add another fresh tablespoon of olive oil and continue until all the meat is brown. </step>
    <step num="3">Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan and sauté the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic until softened, about 3-4 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour in the wine and let it boil off and reduce until barely any remains in the pan. </step>
    <step num="5">Next, add the browned meat back to the pan, along with the tomato paste. Stir until tomato paste is coating all the ingredients and allow the paste to toast slightly. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour in the tomatoes, stock, and herb bundle and stir, bring to a simmer and cover with a lid. </step>
    <step num="7">Allow to simmer for 3 hours, stirring occasionally. Alternatively, if your pot and lid are oven safe, cook in a 325˚F (170˚C) oven for 3 hours. </step>
    <step num="8">Remove the herb bundle and beef shank. </step>
    <step num="9">Pull the meat from the oxtail. Using a fork or tongs, discarding the bone and any extra cartilage or extra fat. Add the meat back to the ragu and stir. </step>
    <step num="10">Skim off any extra fat from the top of the ragu. </step>
    <step num="11">Cook pasta in boiling salted water until al dente. Reserve 1 cup (120 ml) of the pasta water before draining. </step>
    <step num="12">Add a few ladlefuls of ragu, the pasta, and a splash of pasta water to a large pot, gently stir to coat the pasta in the ragu. </step>
    <step num="13">Add a handful of cheese and stir to melt into the sauce. </step>
    <step num="14">Garnish with more cheese and fresh parsley before serving. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
