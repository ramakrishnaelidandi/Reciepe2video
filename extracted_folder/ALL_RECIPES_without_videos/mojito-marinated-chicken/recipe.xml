  <steps>
    <step num="0">Slice the chicken breasts in half lengthways. </step>
    <step num="1">Put all of the ingredients into a ziplock bag and stir them all about so everything is coated and mixed up. </step>
    <step num="2">Marinate for at least 4 hours, but try to leave them over night if you have the time. </step>
    <step num="3">Cook the chicken as you usually would, we used a griddle pan on a medium heat for about 6-7 minutes on each side, but these can go in a regular pan, the oven or even on the BBQ! </step>
    <step num="4">Don’t forget to give it one last squeeze of lemon juice to give it that extra kick! </step>
    <step num="5">Enjoy! </step>
