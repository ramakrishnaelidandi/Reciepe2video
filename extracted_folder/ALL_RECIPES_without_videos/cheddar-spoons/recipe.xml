  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 325˚F (160˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Using an electric hand mixer or stand mixer, beat the cheese, butter, and salt in a large bowl. </step>
    <step num="2">Once combined, mix in the flour and add the ice water one tablespoon at a time. The dough should hold together when pressed but crumble apart if you break it up in your hand. If it seems too dry, add a little more ice water. </step>
    <step num="3">Divide the dough in half and pack together into 2 discs. Wrap in parchment paper and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Roll out the dough to ¼ inch (6 mm) thick, pinching together the cracks on the edges. </step>
    <step num="5">Trace and cut out 6 spoon shapes from each disc of dough. </step>
    <step num="6">Place the cut-out cheese spoons on top of greased, upside-down spoons on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Lightly press down to mold the dough to each spoon’s shape. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve with layered taco dip, if desired. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
