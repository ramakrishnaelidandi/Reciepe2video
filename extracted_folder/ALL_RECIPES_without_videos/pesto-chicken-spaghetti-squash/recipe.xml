  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400°F/200°C. </step>
    <step num="1">Using a fork, pierce holes along one side of the spaghetti squash. </step>
    <step num="2">Microwave the squash for 5 minutes to make it easier to cut open. </step>
    <step num="3">Using a sharp knife, cut the squash in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with a spoon. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the squash to a roasting pan and drizzle with oil. Season the flesh with salt and pepper, and flip the squash so that the cavity faces down on the pan. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 40 minutes until the squash is easily pierced with a knife. </step>
    <step num="6">Once out of the oven, use a fork to pull the threads out of the spaghetti squash. </step>
    <step num="7">Heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat in a large, nonstick skillet. Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper and sear them on each side for about 4 minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">Remove the chicken from the pan and allow it to rest for 5 minutes before slicing into cubes. </step>
    <step num="9">Toss the green beans into the pan and sauté until they’ve started to soften. </step>
    <step num="10">Add in the spaghetti squash, pesto, and chicken, and toss until well combined. </step>
    <step num="11">After the mixture is heated through, toss in the cherry tomatoes and give the pan one last toss to help everything come together. </step>
    <step num="12">Remove from heat and serve. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
