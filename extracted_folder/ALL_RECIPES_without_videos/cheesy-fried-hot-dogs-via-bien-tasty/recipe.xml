  <steps>
    <step num="0">Place a hot dog in the middle of a cheese slice. </step>
    <step num="1">Roll the cheese slice around the hot dog, then push a wooden skewer inside. </step>
    <step num="2">Place the cheese-wrapped hot dogs seam side down on a baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="3">Freeze for 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, pepper, baking powder, milk, and eggs, stirring until the batter is smooth and has no lumps. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour the batter into a tall glass cup for easier dipping. </step>
    <step num="6">Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat until 375°F-400°F (190°C-200°C). </step>
    <step num="7">Take a frozen hot dog and dip it fully into the batter, lifting it out then rotating it to let excess batter drip off. </step>
    <step num="8">Using tongs, carefully place the battered dog into the hot oil, rotating it so that it frys evenly. Remove when golden brown, then pat with a paper towel to drain. </step>
    <step num="9">Serve with ketchup and mustard! </step>
