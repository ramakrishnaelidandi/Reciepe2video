  <steps>
    <step num="0">Whisk the egg in a small bowl. Add 120 grams (1 cup) of flour and water. Whisk to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator. </step>
    <step num="1">Add flour to a shallow dish. Dip each shrimp in the flour, shaking off any excess. </step>
    <step num="2">Dip the floured shrimp into the batter. </step>
    <step num="3">Heat oil in a pot to 350°F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="4">Fry the shrimp until they float to the top and become golden brown in color. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the shrimp to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. </step>
    <step num="5">For the mayonnaise sauce, combine mayonnaise, ketchup, honey, and vinegar. </step>
    <step num="6">Line a ramekin with plastic wrap, and mold ¼ of the rice into a patty. Repeat until you have 6 rice “buns.” </step>
    <step num="7">Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add a splash of sesame oil. Add the rice “buns” and cook until the outside is crispy, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">Top the rice "bun" with a piece of green leaf lettuce, fried shrimps, mayonnaise sauce, and top with another rice “bun.” Repeat with remaining ingredients. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
