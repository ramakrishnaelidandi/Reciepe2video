  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease a 9x13-inch (23x33-cm) baking dish with non-stick cooking spray </step>
    <step num="1">Peel the potatoes, then shred on the large holes of a box grater. Transfer to a large bowl of water and swirl around to remove excess starch. Drain and rinse, then place the potatoes in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze until they’re completely dry. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the shredded potatoes to a clean, large bowl with the salt, pepper, garlic powder, cayenne, onion powder, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil. Toss until fully combined. </step>
    <step num="3">Transfer the potato mixture to the baking dish. Spread evenly. </step>
    <step num="4">Bake for 1½ hours, or until the potatoes are tender throughout and golden brown on the top and bottom. </step>
    <step num="5">Press the bottom of a glass into the potato mixture to create 6 evenly spaced wells. </step>
    <step num="6">Shingle slices of cheddar cheese and ham around the wells, then crack an egg into each one. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 15 minutes more, or until the cheese melts and the egg whites are set. The egg yolks should still be slightly soft. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve and sprinkle with chives, if desired. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
