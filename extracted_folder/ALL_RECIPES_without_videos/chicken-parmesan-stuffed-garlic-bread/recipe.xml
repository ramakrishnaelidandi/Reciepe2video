  <steps>
    <step num="0">Slice the chicken breast into ½ inch (1 ¼ cm) thick strips. </step>
    <step num="1">Place the flour, eggs, and bread crumbs into 3 separate bowls. </step>
    <step num="2">Roll a chicken strip in the flour, dusting off excess. Dip the strip into the egg, then place into the bread crumbs, coating it completely. </step>
    <step num="3">Repeat with the remaining chicken. </step>
    <step num="4">Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat to 350˚F (180˚C) and preheat oven to 350°F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="5">Fry the breaded chicken strips until both sides are golden brown. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove from heat and drain on a paper towel. </step>
    <step num="7">Slice the baguette into thirds or fourths (each baguette piece should be roughly the same length of the fried chicken strips). </step>
    <step num="8">Hollow out the insides of the baguette pieces with a knife. </step>
    <step num="9">Lay two slices of mozzarella on top of each other with a 1 inch (2 ½ cm) overlap. Place a chicken strip on the overlapping region, then fold the mozzarella tightly around the chicken. </step>
    <step num="10">Push the rolled chicken strips into a baguette piece. </step>
    <step num="11">Slice the stuffed baguette pieces into 1 inch (2 ½ cm) slices, then place them tightly side-by-side on a baking sheet lined with foil. </step>
    <step num="12">In a small bowl, mix together ingredients for garlic butter. </step>
    <step num="13">Brush the garlic butter evenly over the baguette slices, making sure some drips in between the slices. </step>
    <step num="14">Wrap the foil over the re-assembled baguette and bake for 20–25 minutes, until cheese is melted and the top is starting to brown. </step>
    <step num="15">Remove the foil and serve with marinara! </step>
    <step num="16">Enjoy! </step>
