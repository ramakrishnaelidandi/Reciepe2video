  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350째 F/150째C. </step>
    <step num="1">Heat the oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat. </step>
    <step num="2">Cook the beef, salt, and pepper until the moisture has evaporated and the beef is starting to brown. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the garlic and onion and cook until onions are starting to become translucent. </step>
    <step num="4">Add one cup of the marinara sauce and cook until the sauce has reduced to a paste. </step>
    <step num="5">Using a large spoon or a spatula, push some of the beef mixture toward the side of the pan, creating a gap that allows you to slide lasagna sheets underneath the beef. Break about two lasagna sheets in order to fill in the cracks. </step>
    <step num="6">Top the beef mixture with the rest of the lasagna sheets. Spread the rest of the marinara sauce on top of the sheets. Dollop the ricotta on top of the sauce and spread evenly. </step>
    <step num="7">Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the ricotta, and top with the basil. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 25 minutes until cheese is bubbly and golden brown. </step>
    <step num="9">Cool, slice, then serve. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
