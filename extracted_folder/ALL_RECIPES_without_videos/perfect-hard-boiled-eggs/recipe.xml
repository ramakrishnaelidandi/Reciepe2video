    <step num="0">Place eggs in a pot. Cover with cold water until the eggs are covered by about 1 inch of water. </step>
    <step num="1">Bring to a boil, uncovered. Once boiling, take off the heat. </step>
    <step num="2">Cover and cook for 4-16 minutes, depending on preference (4-6 minutes for soft-boiled, 8-10 minutes for medium-boiled, 12-16 minutes for hard-boiled). In the meantime, fill a large bowl with ice and cold water, creating an ice bath. </step>
    <step num="3">Once eggs reach desired cook-time, immediately remove the eggs from pot and place in the ice bath. Allow eggs to cool for 10-15 minutes. </step>

    <step num="6">Serve as is or incorporate into your favorite recipe that requires hard-boiled eggs. </step>
