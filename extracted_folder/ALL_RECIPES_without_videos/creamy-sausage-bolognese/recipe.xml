    <step num="0">In a large pot, set on medium heat, add the olive oil and sauté the onions, celery, carrots, and garlic until they are soft, about 10-15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Add garlic and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the ground beef and the sausages. Season with salt and pepper, and break up the meat with a spoon and frying until no longer pink. </step>
    <step num="3">Next, add the tomato paste, Italian seasoning, and red wine. Stir and reduce until the wine has almost completely evaporated. </step>
    <step num="4">Now add all the remaining ingredients, except the parmesan and cream. Stir to ensure everything is well mixed. </step>
