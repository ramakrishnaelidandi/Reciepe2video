  <steps>
    <step num="0">Slice the eggplant and lay out on a paper towel lined baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="1">Generously salt the eggplant on both sides and leave to sit for 30 minutes to soften and draw out excess moisture. </step>
    <step num="2">Blot off the water and excess salt from the eggplant with additional paper towels. </step>
    <step num="3">In a medium mixing bowl add the basil, ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, and one egg (beaten). Mix together. </step>
    <step num="4">Picking two equal sized eggplant slices, sandwich about a tablespoon of the ricotta mixture between the slices and place on a wax paper lined baking tray. </step>
    <step num="5">Freeze for 30 minutes to 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="6">In three separate bowls, place the flour, bread crumbs, and the remaining 3 eggs, beaten. </step>
    <step num="7">Remove eggplant from the freezer and coat each first in flour, then egg, then bread crumbs. Coat once more in egg and a final time in the bread crumbs. Place back in the freezer while you prepare to fry. </step>
    <step num="8">In a large saucepan, heat oil to 350˚F (180˚C). Fry eggplant in batches, 3 at a time, until nicely browned on all sides. </step>
    <step num="9">Remove and place on a paper towel lined plate to drain off any excess oil. Sprinkle with salt. Serve with marinara sauce. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
