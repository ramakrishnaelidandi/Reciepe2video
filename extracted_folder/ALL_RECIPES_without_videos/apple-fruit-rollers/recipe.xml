  <steps>
    <step num="0">Place apples and honey in a food processor or blender and puree into a thick, smooth sauce. </step>
    <step num="1">Transfer the sauce to a sauce pan over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until enough moisture has cooked off that pools of liquid are no longer forming when running a spatula through the mixture, about 5-7 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Pour the sauce onto a baking tray lined with a silicone baking mat and smooth into a thin, even layer. </step>
    <step num="3">Bake for 6 hours at 175ºF (80ºC), until entire surface is just dry to the touch. </step>
    <step num="4">Once cool, turn the baking mat onto a cutting board and remove the silicone baking mat. </step>
    <step num="5">Roll the fruit sheet and cut into 1-inch (2 cm) pieces. </step>
    <step num="6">NOTE: If your fruit sheet comes out a bit too dry and you worry that rolling will cause it to crack, simply cover the surface with a few damp paper towels for a few minutes and try again. The moisture will rehydrate your fruit sheet just enough to be a flexible consistency. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
