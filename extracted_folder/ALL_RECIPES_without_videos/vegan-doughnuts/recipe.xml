  <steps>
    <step num="0">Gently melt the butter over a low-medium heat. Add milk and 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil and mix together. </step>
    <step num="1">Once combined, take off the heat and set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">In a separate bowl, combine the flour, half of the sugar, baking powder and salt with a fork. </step>
    <step num="3">Make a well in the center and pour in the butter mixture. Combine gradually until a thick dough forms. </step>
    <step num="4">Using your hands, roll dough into little flat balls and with your thumb, press a hole in the center of each doughnut. (You may need to flour your hands for this part to avoid getting sticky!) </step>
    <step num="5">Heat up oil in a pan. To know when it's hot enough, fry a little bit of bread in the oil. If it goes brown and floats to the top, in 45-50 seconds the oil will be ready! </step>
    <step num="6">Gently lay the doughnuts into the oil using a spatula. Fry for about 3-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer the doughnuts onto some tissue paper to soak up any excess oil. </step>
    <step num="8">Roll the doughnut into a bowl of the remaining half of sugar. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
