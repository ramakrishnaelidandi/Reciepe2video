  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a saucepan over medium heat, bring the butter brown sugar and corn syrup to a boil. Remove from heat. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the flour and nuts into the butter mixture. Stir until cooled, about 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">On a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, use a teaspoon to scoop 5 balls 5 inches (13 cm) apart onto the baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="4">Bake for 6-7 minutes, until the edges are a deep golden color. </step>
    <step num="5">Let the cookies cool for about 1 minute, until they are cool enough to handle but still flexible. </step>
    <step num="6">Place the cookie over the backside of a muffin tin and gently form until the cookie is a cup shape. Wait until the cookie has hardened into the cup shape, then remove from the muffin tin, about 1 minute. </step>
    <step num="7">In a bowl, microwave the chocolate in 20-second intervals, stirring in between for 1 minute. </step>
    <step num="8">Take one of the pecan lace cookie cups and dip the edge into the chocolate. Let cool. </step>
    <step num="9">Place one dollop of whipped cream in the cookie cup and top with 2 strawberry halves and 3 raspberries. Serve immediately. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
