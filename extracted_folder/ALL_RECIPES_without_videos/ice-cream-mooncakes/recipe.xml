    <step num="4">Layer on more strawberry or coffee ice cream. </step>
    <step num="5">Top it off with the biscuits crumbs and press down. Freeze for another two hours. </step>
    <step num="6">Prepare the chocolate coating, melt the chocolate chips and coconut oil. Stir until combined and smooth. Set aside until it has cooled to room temp. </step>
