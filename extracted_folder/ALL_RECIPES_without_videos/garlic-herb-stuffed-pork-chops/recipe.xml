  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, pepper, garlic powder, chives, provolone, and bacon, stirring until thoroughly mixed. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Season all sides of the pork chops with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="3">Carefully cut a pocket through the side of the pork chop in order to create a cavity. Stuff the cavity with a generous spoonful of the cream cheese mixture and press around the edges of the pork to seal it in. Repeat with the remaining pork chops. </step>
    <step num="4">Dip the stuffed pork chops in the flour, shaking off excess, then the egg, then the breadcrumbs. Repeat with the remaining pork chops. </step>
    <step num="5">Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat. Fry the pork chops for about one to two minutes, then flip. Remove from the heat and bake for 15-20 minutes, until cheese is bubbling and starting to brown. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
