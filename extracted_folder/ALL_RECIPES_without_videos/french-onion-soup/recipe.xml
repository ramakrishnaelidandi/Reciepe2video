  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat Oven To 325˚F (160˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large pot over medium-low heat, heat olive oil and add butter. Once the butter is melted, stir the onions and coat with oil and butter. </step>
    <step num="2">Cover and cook for 20 minutes, checking occasionally. </step>
    <step num="3">Turn up the heat to medium-high. Add ½ tsp salt and sugar. Stir and keep cooking until onions are brown and caramelized. (the bottom of the pan will develop some browning, it’s very important!) </step>
    <step num="4">Stir in flour one tablespoon at a time and cook for about 30 seconds. </step>
    <step num="5">Add 1 cup (235 ml) of the beef broth. Use a whisk to scrape up (deglaze) the browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the remaining five cups of beef stock, wine, sage and bay leaf. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 40 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">In the meantime, cut the french bread or baguette into ½ inch (10 mm) thick pieces. Brush with oil on both sides and bake at 325˚F (160˚C) for 30 minutes, flipping halfway. Once they are done, increase oven temperature to 350˚F (175˚C). </step>
    <step num="8">Add optional ingredients. </step>
    <step num="9">In an oven safe bowl, pour the onion soup, filling about ¾ of the way full. Top with a piece of baked french bread, and generously sprinkle swiss and parmesan on top. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake for two to three minutes or until the cheese has melted completely and become slightly golden. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
