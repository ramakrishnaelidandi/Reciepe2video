  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). </step>
    <step num="1">If using fresh dough, let sit out at room temperature for 30 minutes in a covered and lightly oiled bowl. </step>
    <step num="2">On a floured surface, take one half of the dough and roll it out into a rectangle, about ⅛ of an inch (3 mm) thick. Repeat with other half of dough and set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">Lightly oil your ice cube tray if it’s hard plastic. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the dough to cover the tray and press the dough down into every hole, holding for about 5 seconds to ensure the dough stretches properly. If it tears, you can use excess dough to patch up any holes. </step>
    <step num="5">Assemble each bite with approximately one teaspoon of sauce, such as marinara or pesto, one teaspoon of cheese, and desired toppings. </step>
    <step num="6">Cover the prepared bites with remaining dough and roll over the ice cube tray with rolling pin to seal. </step>
    <step num="7">Trim any excess dough and save for more pizza bites. </step>
    <step num="8">Freeze the ice cube tray for about an hour, until the dough has set. </step>
    <step num="9">Flip the tray onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet to release the bites. If necessary, use a paring knife to gently loosen. </step>
    <step num="10">Cut and separate the bites. </step>
    <step num="11">Bake for 15-20 minutes, until the dough is golden brown and serve warm. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
