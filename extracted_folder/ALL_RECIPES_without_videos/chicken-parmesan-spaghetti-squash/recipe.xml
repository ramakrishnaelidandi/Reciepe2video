  <steps>
    <step num="0">With a sharp knife, slice the squash in half. (If the squash is too tough - puncture in several places forming a dotted line around the squash. Microwave for 3-5 minutes to soften. Allow to cool before cutting in half - following the dotted line). </step>
    <step num="1">Scoop out the seeds - brush with oil, salt, and pepper. </step>
    <step num="2">Roast face down in a preheated oven at 375˚F (190˚C) for 35-40 minutes (until a fork can easily pierce the skin). </step>
    <step num="3">Meanwhile - Slice the chicken breasts into strips. Season with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="4">Place flour, beaten egg, and breadcrumbs into three separate bowls. </step>
    <step num="5">Coat each strip with flour, then egg, and then roll in bread crumbs. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour oil in a cast-iron skillet to come ¼ inch up the side. Heat the oil over medium-high heat. </step>
    <step num="7">Fry the chicken strips (in batches if necessary) until golden brown on all sides and cooked through. Transfer to paper towels and remove pan from heat. </step>
    <step num="8">Once the squash has finished roasting - remove from the oven and let it set for a few minutes before turing over and pulling at it with a fork. </step>
    <step num="9">Shred the inside of each squash, being careful not to poke through the skin. </step>
    <step num="10">Pour marinara sauce over shredded squash. Top with chicken strips, then more marinara, and finish with mozzarella and parmesan cheese, and a pinch of Italian seasoning. </step>
    <step num="11">Return to the oven to bake for 10-15 minutes until the cheese has melted. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
