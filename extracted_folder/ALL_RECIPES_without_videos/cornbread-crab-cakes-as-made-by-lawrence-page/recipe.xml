  <steps>
    <step num="0">Over a large bowl, crumble the cornbread into fine crumbs until you have about 2 cups (200 g) worth. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the red pepper, green onion, mayonnaise, sour cream, parsley, cilantro, garlic, beaten eggs, Old Bay seasoning, olive oil, salt, pepper, and crab meat to the bowl. </step>
    <step num="2">Break up the crab meat into fine pieces until it is all uniform in size. </step>
    <step num="3">Mix all the ingredients together with your hands or a wooden spoon until evenly combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Form the mixture into small patties, about 2.5 inches (6 cm) in diameter and ¾-inch (2 cm) thick and set aside. </step>
    <step num="5">Add enough vegetable oil to a large skillet to come about ¼-inch (6 mm) up the sides. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="6">Fry the crab cakes in batches, about 3-4 at a time. Cook on each side until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer to a paper-towel lined plate to drain. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve with your choice of dipping sauce, or they’re great just on their own! </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
