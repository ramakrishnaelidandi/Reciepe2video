  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the cream cheese filling: In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, powdered sugar, flour, and vanilla. Mix with a fork until smooth. </step>
    <step num="1">Scoop 16 teaspoon-sized balls of icing onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Freeze for at least 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="2">Make the cookies: Preheat the oven to 350°F (180˚C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. (Do not use a silicone mat--if the bottoms of the cookies are too thin, the silicone will stick to the cookies and the icing centers will fall through when removed from the pan.) </step>
    <step num="3">In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">In a large bowl, combine the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar, and beat with an electric hand mixer or whisk for 1-2 minutes, or until well combined. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the eggs, 1 at a time, then the vanilla and cinnamon and beat until combined. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the flour mixture and beat until just incorporated. </step>
    <step num="7">Fold in the carrots, raisins, and pecans with a rubber spatula. </step>
    <step num="8">Scoop 16 heaping tablespoons of dough onto 2 prepared baking sheets, spacing at least 3 inches apart. Flatten each scoop with moistened fingers. </step>
    <step num="9">Place a frozen icing ball in the center of each dough round. </step>
    <step num="10">Top the filling with another scoop of dough and use moistened fingers to flatten and seal the edges so the filling is completely encased. </step>
    <step num="11">Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the edges are light brown. Be careful not to overbake or the filling will ooze out. </step>
    <step num="12">Let the cookies cool completely. This is important! If you try to lift the cookies before they are cool and the icing is still warm, it could fall through the cookies. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
