  <steps>
    <step num="0">Season the sushi rice with the rice vinegar, fanning and stirring until room temperature. </step>
    <step num="1">On the rolling mat place one sheet of nori with the rough side facing upwards. </step>
    <step num="2">Wet your hands and grab a handful of rice and place it on the nori. Spread the rice evenly throughout the nori without smushing the rice down. </step>
    <step num="3">Arrange, in a horizontal row 1 inch (2 cm) from the bottom, smoked salmon, cream cheese, and cucumber. </step>
    <step num="4">Grabbing both nori and the mat, roll the mat over the filling so the extra space at the bottom touches the other side, squeezing down to make a nice tight roll. Squeeze down along the way to keep the roll from holding its shape. </step>
    <step num="5">Transfer the roll onto a cutting board. Rub a knife on a damp paper towel before slicing the roll into six equal portions. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
