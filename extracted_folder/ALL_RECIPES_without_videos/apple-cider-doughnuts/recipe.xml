    <step num="0">Bring apple cider to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce down to ½ cup (120 ml) (takes about 20-25 minutes). </step>
    <step num="1">Pour into a large glass measuring cup. </step>
    <step num="2">Add butter to hot cider and stir to melt. Set aside, cool. </step>

    <step num="6">Cover and chill for 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="7">On a very well-floured surface, roll out the cooled dough to about ¾-inch (2 cm) thickness and cut into donut shapes using pastry cutters or a mason jar/cup and a bottle cap/shot glass. Chill cut donuts 10 minutes more if necessary. </step>
