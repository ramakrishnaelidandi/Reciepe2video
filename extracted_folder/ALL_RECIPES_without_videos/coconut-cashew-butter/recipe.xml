    <step num="0">NOTE: If you have unroasted nuts, preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Spread cashews onto a baking tray and bake for 10-12 minutes or until you can smell them. </step>
    <step num="1">In a food processor, blend raw cashews. Scrape down the sides when necessary. Nuts should turn into a ball then even out. </step>

    <step num="3">Blend until well combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour into a jar, store in a refrigerator and use within one month. </step>
