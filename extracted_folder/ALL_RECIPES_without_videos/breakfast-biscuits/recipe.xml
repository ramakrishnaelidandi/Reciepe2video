  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the onion and stir until translucent. Add the chorizo. </step>
    <step num="2">NOTE: You don’t need to use more salt since chorizo has enough salt. </step>
    <step num="3">Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the bell peppers and stir. </step>
    <step num="4">Beat the eggs until the yolks break and add them to the chorizo mix. </step>
    <step num="5">Stir until the eggs are just cooked. </step>
    <step num="6">Flour a surface and open a tube of biscuits. Place them close to each other. Roll them out with a rolling pin to create one single dough. </step>
    <step num="7">Sprinkle cheddar cheese over the rolled biscuit dough. Add the chorizo and eggs. Roll it up and pinch the edge to seal it to the roll. </step>
    <step num="8">Brush the roll with egg wash. </step>
    <step num="9">Using scissors, make slits in the dough about 2 inches (5 cm) apart from each other. Then twist them to alternating sides to create a braided look. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
