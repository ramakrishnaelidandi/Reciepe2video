    <step num="0">Peel the bananas and slice off the tops and bottoms to create a straighter middle section. Save ends for later. </step>
    <step num="1">Insert a popsicle stick into the middle of each banana and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="2">Freeze the bananas until solid, about 1 hour. </step>
