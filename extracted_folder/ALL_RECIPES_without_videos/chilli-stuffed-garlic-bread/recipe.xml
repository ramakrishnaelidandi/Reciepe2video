  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a saucepan, cook the onion and 2 garlic cloves in a little oil. </step>
    <step num="1">After a minute or so, add the minced beef, breaking it up with a spoon. </step>
    <step num="2">When the mince has browned, stir in the chilli powder, cumin, ground coriander, and the plain flour. </step>
    <step num="3">Stir in the beef stock, tomatoes, tomato purée, kidney beans, oregano, and salt. </step>
    <step num="4">Place a bay leaf into the mixture, loosely cover and simmer for 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow to cool some so you don’t burn yourself during the next bit! </step>
    <step num="5">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F. </step>
    <step num="6">Top and tail the baguette, then cut it into 3-4 equal rolls. </step>
    <step num="7">Hollow out each roll, allowing a thin border of bread around the outside. </step>
    <step num="8">Stuff each roll with chili using a teaspoon. Try to really fill them up. </step>
    <step num="9">Make the garlic butter by stirring in 2 cloves of crushed garlic and a handful of parsley into the melted butter. </step>
    <step num="10">Coat each stuffed roll with a generous helping of garlic butter. Top with a healthy portion of finely grated cheddar. </step>
    <step num="11">Bake in the centre of the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and melted. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
