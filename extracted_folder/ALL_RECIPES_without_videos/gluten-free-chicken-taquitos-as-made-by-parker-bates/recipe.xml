  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="1">Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the jalapeños and cook for 30 seconds, until starting to soften. Add the chicken, thyme, seasoned salt, parsley, dill, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through, 8-10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Remove the pan from the heat. Transfer the chicken to a large bowl and use an electric hand mixer on low speed or 2 forks to shred the chicken. </step>
    <step num="3">Return the shredded chicken to the pan and turn the heat to low. Add the cream cheese and Parmesan and stir until melted. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">Wrap the tortillas in a damp towel. Microwave for 45 seconds to soften. </step>
    <step num="5">Add 1-2 tablespoons of filling to the center of a tortilla and roll the tortilla tightly around the filling. Place on the prepared baking sheet, seam-side down. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. </step>
    <step num="6">Brush the melted butter over the taquitos. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake the taquitos for 10 minutes, flip, then return to the oven for another 15 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve the taquitos with shredded lettuce, sour cream, and salsa. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
