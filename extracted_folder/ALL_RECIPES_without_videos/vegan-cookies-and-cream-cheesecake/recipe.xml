  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a bowl, soak cashews in boiling water for 1-2 hours. </step>
    <step num="1">Prepare the bottom of a 9-inch (23 cm) springform cake pan with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="2">In the bowl of a food processor, blend 20 cookies for 30 seconds, then pour in coconut oil and continue blending until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. </step>
    <step num="3">Press the crumbs into the bottom of the cake pan to form an even layer. </step>
    <step num="4">Freeze for 1 hour, or until the filling is prepared and ready. </step>
    <step num="5">Scrape the filling from 10 sandwich cookies and reserve both the filling and cookies. </step>
    <step num="6">Drain cashews and add to the bowl of a food processor. Blend until nuts start to ball up and stick together, approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute. </step>
    <step num="7">Add coconut cream and cookie cream filling to the cashews and blend until fully incorporated, then add lemon juice and continue to blend until smooth. It will resemble slightly coarser hummus. </step>
    <step num="8">Once smooth, crumble in half of the reserved scraped cookies and pulse until incorporated, but not crushed. </step>
    <step num="9">Remove the crust from the freezer and smooth out half of the filling over the bottom. Crumble the remaining scraped cookies on top, then smooth out remaining filling over it. Decorate as desired. </step>
    <step num="10">Freeze for at least 1 hour before serving. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
