  <steps>
    <step num="0">First, make Tia’s Cornbread at least one day before serving the stuffing. </step>
    <step num="1">Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Generously grease a 9-inch (23 cm) baking pan with 1 tablespoon of butter. </step>
    <step num="2">In a small bowl, mix the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. In another bowl, whisk together the melted butter, buttermilk, corn, honey and eggs. Using a rubber spatula, add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix just until combined. Do not overmix. </step>
    <step num="3">Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Let cool for at least 1 hour, then cut into 1-inch cubes for the stuffing. </step>
    <step num="4">For the stuffing, start by cutting the cornbread into cubes. </step>
    <step num="5">Spread 4 cups of white bread cubes and 4 cups of the cornbread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet and leave out overnight to dry out. </step>
    <step num="6">Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease a 13x9x2-inch (33x23x2 cm) baking dish with butter and set aside. </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer the bread cubes to a large bowl. </step>
    <step num="8">In a large sauté pan set over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add the onion, garlic, celery, fennel and sprinkle with the salt and cook until the vegetables are translucent, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Add the mixture to the bowl of bread and mix. </step>
    <step num="10">In the same sauté pan, add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and let brown for 30 seconds. Add the apples and nutmeg and sauté until the apples are tender, 3 to 4 minutes. </step>
    <step num="11">Add the apples to the bread bowl and mix. </step>
    <step num="12">Add the sausage to the pan and cook, breaking it up as it browns, 8 to 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="13">Transfer the sausage to the bread bowl and mix. </step>
    <step num="14">Mix in the parsley and sage. </step>
    <step num="15">Transfer the bread mixture to the buttered baking dish. </step>
    <step num="16">Pour the chicken stock around the edges of the baking dish. </step>
    <step num="17">Put the baking dish on the middle oven rack and bake at 400°F (200°C), uncovered for 40 minutes, until golden brown. </step>
