  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 375°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium-sized bowl, add the flour and salt. Mix with fork until combined. </step>
    <step num="2">Add in cubed butter and break up into flour with a fork. Mixture will still have lumps about the size of small peas. </step>
    <step num="3">Gradually add in ice water and continue to mix until the dough starts to come together. You may not need all of the water, but if the dough is too dry then add more. The dough should not be very tacky or sticky. </step>
    <step num="4">Work the dough together with your hands and turn out onto a surface. Work into a ball and cover with cling wrap. Refrigerate. </step>
    <step num="5">Peel the apples, then core and slice. </step>
    <step num="6">In a bowl, add the sliced apples, sugar, flour, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and juice from the lemon. </step>
    <step num="7">Mix until combined and all apples are coated. Refrigerate. </step>
    <step num="8">On a floured surface, cut the pie dough in half and roll out both halves until round and about ⅛-inch (3.2 mm) thick. </step>
    <step num="9">Roll the dough around the rolling pin and unroll onto a pie dish making sure the dough reaches all edges. Trim extra if necessary. </step>
    <step num="10">Pour in apple filling mixture and pat down. </step>
    <step num="11">Roll the other half of the dough on top. </step>
    <step num="12">Trim the extra dough from the edges and pinch the edges to create a crimp. Make sure edges are sealed together. </step>
    <step num="13">Brush the pie with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the sugar. </step>
    <step num="14">Cut four slits in the top of the pie to create a vent. </step>
    <step num="15">Bake pie for 50-60 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and no greyish or undercooked pastry remains. </step>
    <step num="16">Allow to cool completely before slicing. </step>
    <step num="17">Top with ice cream and serve. </step>
    <step num="18">Enjoy! </step>
