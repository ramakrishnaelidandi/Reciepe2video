  <steps>
    <step num="0">Prepare the cakes according to the package, or use your favorite cake recipe. </step>
    <step num="1">To make the buttercream, mix the butter, vanilla, milk, and powdered sugar in a bowl with a hand mixer. </step>
    <step num="2">Once the cakes are baked and cooled, place one cake on a turntable. If you don't have one, you can use a plate. Slice the top off the cakes to create a flat surface. </step>
    <step num="3">Place a large dollop of the buttercream on the cake and spread to create an even middle layer of frosting. </step>
    <step num="4">Place the second cake over the layer of buttercream. </step>
    <step num="5">Frost the entire cake to create the crumb layer, creating a smooth surface. </step>
    <step num="6">Place the cake in the freezer to keep cold. </step>
    <step num="7">For the glaze, boil the water, sugar, and condensed milk in a pot for 1 minute, then remove from heat. </step>
    <step num="8">Bloom the gelatin in 8 cups (2 liters) of cold water for 5 minutes, then wring the gelatin sheets of excess water and mix into the sugar mixture. </step>
    <step num="9">Pour the sugar mixture over the chocolate, letting it sit for 2-3 minutes to allow the chocolate to soften. </step>
    <step num="10">Using an immersion blender, carefully blend the chocolate and the liquid, making sure that you are not blending in air bubbles by lifting up the blender too high. </step>
    <step num="11">Pour the glaze through a sieve into a large bowl to remove any excess bubbles. </step>
    <step num="12">Separate the glaze into 5 different bowls (one medium-sized bowl and four smaller bowls). </step>
    <step num="13">Color the biggest bowl of glaze with black and navy blue food coloring, stir the coloring with the glaze until the color is distributed evenly. </step>
    <step num="14">In the next bowl, add the navy blue food coloring and stir. </step>
    <step num="15">In the next bowl, add the lighter blue food coloring and stir. </step>
    <step num="16">In the next bowl, add the purple food coloring and stir. </step>
    <step num="17">In the next bowl, add the pink food coloring and stir. </step>
    <step num="18">When you are ready to use the glaze, make sure each one is around 90-96°F (32-35°C). Microwave if necessary. Pour the colored glazes back into the biggest bowl of black and blue glaze. Swirl them gently with a spoon. </step>
    <step num="19">Place the cake on a stand over a sheet tray to catch any excess glaze. Carefully pour the glaze over the cake. </step>
    <step num="20">Dip a brush into the white food coloring and fling it onto the cake to create stars. </step>
    <step num="21">Enjoy! </step>
