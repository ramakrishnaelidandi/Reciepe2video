  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a 6-quart/6-liter dutch oven, cook chicken over medium-high heat until brown on both sides. Once chicken pieces are browned, remove and set aside. </step>
    <step num="1">Add carrot and onion and cook until just tender, about 3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Add garlic and stir for another minute. </step>
    <step num="3">Reduce heat to medium-low and add butter and flour, stirring constantly for 3 minutes to avoid lumps. </step>
    <step num="4">Add chicken and any accumulated juices back to dutch oven and stir to coat in roux/vegetable mix. </step>
    <step num="5">Add chicken broth, cream, thyme, and bay leaves and bring to a simmer. Once soup is at a simmer, add frozen peas and cover. </step>
    <step num="6">In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and cream. Stir until mixture comes together into single mass of dough. </step>
    <step num="7">Using a large spoon or ice cream scoop, form dough into small round balls about 1 inch in diameter (this dough mixture should yield 14-16 dumplings). </step>
    <step num="8">Place dough balls into simmering soup (making sure they don’t touch), add fresh parsley, and cover. Let soup simmer for 15 minutes or until dumplings are cooked (they should pass the toothpick test). </step>
    <step num="9">Ladle into bowl, giving 1-2 dumplings per serving. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
