    <step num="1">Roll out your pizza dough (homemade or store bought). Add olive oil. </step>
    <step num="2">Cover with whatever toppings you prefer. </step>
    <step num="3">Bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your preference. We cooked it until the egg whites were cooked, but the egg yolks were still runny. But you do you. </step>
