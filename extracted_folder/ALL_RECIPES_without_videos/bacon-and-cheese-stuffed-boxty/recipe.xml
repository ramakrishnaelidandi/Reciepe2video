  <steps>
    <step num="0">Peel and grate the raw potato, then wrap in a clean towel and squeeze out as much of the liquid as you can. </step>
    <step num="1">Put the grated potato into a large bowl and stir in the cooked mashed potato and the flour. </step>
    <step num="2">Stir in the melted butter and season if necessary. </step>
    <step num="3">Add a bit of milk and stir, then add a bit more milk - keeping doing this until all of the milk is combined into the mixture and you have a somewhat sticky dough, if it’s too wet add a bit more flour. </step>
    <step num="4">Dust your hands and work surface in flour and grab a palm sized amount of the mixture, flattening it out to about 1-cm (¼ in) thick. </step>
    <step num="5">Spoon some grated cheese and some bacon bits into the center and drop another flattened out dough mixture piece on top. </step>
    <step num="6">Cut into a nice round shape using a cookie cutter making sure it’s fully sealed. NOTE: Try not to make these too thick or they might not cook all the way through, if they are thick, lower the temperature to a low-medium heat instead. </step>
    <step num="7">Fry in butter over a medium heat for about 4-6 minutes on each side until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve topped with a tablespoon of soured cream and a few bits of scallions. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
