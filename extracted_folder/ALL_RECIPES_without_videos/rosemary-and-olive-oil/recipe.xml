  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine the almond flour, salt, pepper, and rosemary. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the olive oil and mix thoroughly with a fork. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and mix thoroughly, until small clumps form and the dough holds together when squeezed. </step>
    <step num="4">Form the dough into a round, flattening the top and bottom as evenly as possible. </step>
    <step num="5">Place the dough on a sheet of parchment paper and add another piece of parchment on top. Roll out the dough as evenly as possible, to between ¼- and ⅛-inch (6- and 3-mm) thick. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove the top layer of parchment paper and place on a baking sheet. You may need to press the edges of the dough to form an even rectangle. </step>
    <step num="7">Using a cookie cutter or pizza cutter, slice the dough to desired size. If using a cookie cutter, re-roll the excess dough and cut out more crackers. </step>
    <step num="8">If desired, use the blunt end of a skewer to poke holes in each of the crackers. </step>
    <step num="9">Carefully place the crackers on the baking sheet. If the dough is too warm, the crackers will break as you attempt to transfer them. Chill in the freezer for 10 minutes before proceeding if this happens. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="11">Let the crackers cool completely and serve as desired. Store up to 1 week at room temperature in an airtight container. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
