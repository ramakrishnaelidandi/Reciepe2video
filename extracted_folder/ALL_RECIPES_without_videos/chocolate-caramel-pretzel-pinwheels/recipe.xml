  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 300˚F (150˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Combine cereal and crushed pretzels in a large bowl. </step>
    <step num="2">In another large bowl, melt marshmallows and butter in the microwave for 1 minute &amp; 30 seconds, stirring half way. (Time may vary depending on your microwave, so, keep an eye on it!) </step>
    <step num="3">Combine cereal, pretzels and melted marshmallows. Mix well. </step>
    <step num="4">Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray generously with non-stick cooking spray. (You might want to spray your hands too!) </step>
    <step num="5">Remove marshmallow mixture from the bowl and place onto the baking sheet. Spray another piece of parchment paper with non-stick spray and lay the sprayed side on top of the marshmallow mixture. </step>
    <step num="6">Roll out with a rolling pin into a thin layer. </step>
    <step num="7">Remove the top layer of parchment paper and evenly spread caramel over the marshmallow mixture. Pour chocolate chips over the caramel. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 2 minutes, or until chocolate chips spread easily across the caramel. </step>
    <step num="9">Carefully &amp; tightly roll it up longways, peeling back the parchment paper as you go. Cover in plastic wrap &amp; chill for 2-3 hours, or until it has firmed up nicely. </step>
    <step num="10">Remove plastic wrap and parchment paper, and cut in 1-inch (2 cm) slices. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
