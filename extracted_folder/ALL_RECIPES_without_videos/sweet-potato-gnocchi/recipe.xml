  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400º F (200º C). </step>
    <step num="1">Prick the sweet potato with a fork several times and bake for 40 minutes (or microwave for 5 minutes). </step>
    <step num="2">Allow potato to cool at least 5 minutes before peeling skin off. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large bowl, mash potato with masher or fork until smooth. </step>
    <step num="4">Add parmesan cheese, egg, and flour. Knead the dough until it is firm and no longer sticky, adding flour as needed, forming a ball with the dough. </step>
    <step num="5">Divide the dough into four equal parts. Take one part and roll it out into a long rope, about a 1-inch (2 ½ cm) wide. </step>
    <step num="6">Slice into ½-inch (1 cm) rectangles and set aside. </step>
    <step num="7">Using an overturned fork, slide each gnocchi over the fork prongs so they become serrated in a corkscrew shape. </step>
    <step num="8">Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the gnocchi. Boil until the gnocchi float to the top, about 1-2 minutes. Drain in a colander. </step>
    <step num="9">In a pan over medium heat, melt butter and add sage. Simmer for 1 minute without letting butter burn. </step>
    <step num="10">Add gnocchi to pan with the sage and butter, tossing until lightly golden. </step>
    <step num="11">Top with more Parmesan cheese. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
