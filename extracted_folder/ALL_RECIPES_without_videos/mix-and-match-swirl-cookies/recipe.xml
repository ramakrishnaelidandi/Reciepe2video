  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a medium bowl, cream the butter and sugar with a hand mixer until light and fluffy. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix until fully incorporated. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the flour, baking soda, and baking powder, and mix until the dough is crumbly, but holds together when squeezed. </step>
    <step num="3">Split the base dough in half, add your desired mix-ins, and incorporate them fully. </step>
    <step num="4">We used chocolate hazelnut spread and cocoa powder for one half and peanut butter for the other. </step>
    <step num="5">Roll out each dough between two sheets of parchment paper until it’s ¼-inch (6-mm) thick. Chill both doughs for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Place one half of flavored dough on top of the other and start to roll up the doughs into a swirl. Wrap the roll in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge until solid, about 4 hours. </step>
    <step num="7">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="8">Once chilled, unwrap the dough, slice into ½-inch (1 cm) thick coins, and place them on the baking sheet at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart, as the cookies will spread while baking. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake the cookies for 10 minutes. Let cool at room temperature for about 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="10">Try additional combinations. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
