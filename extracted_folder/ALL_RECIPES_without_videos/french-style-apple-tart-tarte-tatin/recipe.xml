  <steps>
    <step num="0">Using a 9-inch (23 cm) pan, cut a circle out from the puff pastry. Using a fork, poke holes all over to provide ventilation. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="1">Peel and quarter the apples, removing the stems and cores. </step>
    <step num="2">Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). </step>
    <step num="3">In a large saucepan over medium heat, distribute the sugar evenly and cook until a light amber color, stirring to help melt any lumps. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the butter, stirring constantly until the color is a creamy light brown. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the apples, making sure the juices from the apples help dissolve any caramel that sticks to the apples. </step>
    <step num="6">Cook for about 15-20 minutes, making sure the apples are turned constantly so that they bathe in the caramel. Remove from heat when the caramel has reduced to completely glaze the apples and little remains in the bottom of the pan. Be sure not to burn the caramel, tasting it from time to time to ensure it does not taste bitter. </step>
    <step num="7">Arrange the apples in concentric circles on the bottom of the pan. Press the apples tightly against each other, then pour the glaze over the top. </step>
    <step num="8">Lay the circle of puff pastry on top. Tuck the puff pastry down the sides of the pan. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 45-50 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown and firm. </step>
    <step num="10">Cool for about 1 hour, then invert onto a plate. </step>
    <step num="11">Slice, then serve with vanilla ice cream. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
