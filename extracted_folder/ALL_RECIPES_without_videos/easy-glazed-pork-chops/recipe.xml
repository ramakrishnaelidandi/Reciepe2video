  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a bowl, combine your spices (paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, black pepper, and salt). </step>
    <step num="1">Rub the pork chops in the spices generously. </step>
    <step num="2">Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium/high heat. When the oil is hot, add the pork chops. Cook for about 3-5 minutes on each side or until they have a nice caramelized brownness to them. Once you feel that they are looking browned, add a Tablespoon of brown sugar to each pork chop. Turn each pork chop over, so both sides get some melted brown sugar. (Don’t add the brown sugar too early or else the sugar will burn and smoke up the room.) </step>
    <step num="3">Bake at 350˚F (175˚C) for 15 minutes, making sure the pork chops are cooked through. </step>
    <step num="4">Before serving, pour the glaze that’s formed in the pan over the chops. Serve with your vegetables of choice. </step>
    <step num="5">Enjoy! </step>
