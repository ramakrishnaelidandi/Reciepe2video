  <steps>
    <step num="0">Heat a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add olive oil, garlic, and chile flakes. Stir, cooking until the garlic is lightly golden and fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the crushed tomatoes and season with salt, black pepper, and basil. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">On a clean work surface, butterfly the chicken breasts. </step>
    <step num="3">Cover with plastic wrap, and use a rolling pin or meat mallet to pound out the chicken to ¼-inch (6-mm) thick. </step>
    <step num="4">Season each side with salt and black pepper. </step>
    <step num="5">With the cut side of the chicken facing up, arrange a flat layer of 4 half slices of ham, followed by 4 half slices of mozzarella. </step>
    <step num="6">Roll toward you, starting the with the thickest part of the chicken. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Place the panko in a wide, shallow bowl, and add the Parmesan cheese and oregano. Stir to incorporate. Prepare two more wide bowls with the flour and the beaten egg. </step>
    <step num="8">Unwrap the chicken and dredge in the flour, eggs, then bread crumbs. </step>
    <step num="9">Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 325°F (170°C). Add the chicken, two rolls at a time, and cook about 5 minutes per side or until the outside is an even golden brown. If a good color is achieved and the chicken’s center is still not 165°F (74°C), you can finish cooking the chicken in an oven set to 325°F (170°C) until that temperature is reached. </step>
    <step num="10">Place the fried chicken in an ovenproof dish. Spoon the tomato sauce over the top, saving some for serving. </step>
    <step num="11">Arrange fresh mozzarella slices on top. </step>
    <step num="12">Broil on the center rack for 8-10 minutes, until the cheese is melted and has small brown bubbles. </step>
    <step num="13">Garnish with fresh basil and serve with the reserved tomato sauce alongside. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
