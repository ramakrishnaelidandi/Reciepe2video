  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Cut pizza dough into 12 portions. Roll into balls. </step>
    <step num="2">Boil water and add baking soda. </step>
    <step num="3">NOTE: Make sure your pot is narrow enough that the water level covers the dough balls and make sure there’s enough room left in the pot that it won’t boil over when the baking soda is added. </step>
    <step num="4">Place dough balls in the pot, boiling for 20-30 seconds in batches. </step>
    <step num="5">Line a 10” (25 cm) skillet with the dough balls, making a ring along the outside edge. </step>
    <step num="6">Scramble the egg and brush the dough balls with egg wash. Top with salt, to taste. </step>
    <step num="7">Par-bake the dough for 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">While the dough is baking, combine the cream cheese, 1½ cups (150 g) of cheddar, sour cream, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder until smooth. </step>
    <step num="9">Fill the center of the dip ring with the cheese dip. Top the dip and the dough balls with the remaining cheddar. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake for an additional 10-15 minutes (or until the pretzel balls have browned and the dip has fully melted). </step>
    <step num="11">Allow to cool before serving. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
