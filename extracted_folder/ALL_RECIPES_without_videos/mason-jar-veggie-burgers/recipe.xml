    <step num="5">Fill 4 rings with bean mix (they can be compacted to the rim of the ring). </step>
    <step num="6">Fill 8 rings with cornbread batter. (Do not completely fill. Leave a small amount of room at the top to allow for rise, making sure the spread batter evenly throughout ring.) </step>
