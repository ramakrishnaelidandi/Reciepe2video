  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the dough: in a large bowl, combine the warm milk, melted butter, and granulated sugar. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the yeast, baking powder, salt, and 2 cups (250 g) of flour. Stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">Add 2 more cups (250 g) of flour and stir until the dough comes together. </step>
    <step num="3">Flour a clean surface with the remaining cup of flour. Coat your hands with flour. Dump the dough out onto the floured surface and knead until smooth, about 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Place the dough in a large oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for 2 hours in a warm area until it’s doubled in size. </step>
    <step num="5">Make the filling: in a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, powdered sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract until smooth. </step>
    <step num="6">In a medium bowl, combine the raspberry jam with one tablespoon of the cream cheese filling. </step>
    <step num="7">In a small bowl, combine the blueberry jam with one teaspoon of the cream cheese filling. </step>
    <step num="8">Once the dough has risen, lightly flour a clean surface and roll the dough out to a 10x15-inch (25x38-cm) rectangle, about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick. </step>
    <step num="9">Brush about 5 inches (13 cm) of the roll with the cream cheese filling, about 8 inches (20 cm) of the roll with the raspberry filling, and about 1½ inches (3 cm) with the blueberry filling. Set aside the leftover cream cheese filling. </step>
    <step num="10">Starting from the bottom, roll up the dough and cut into 9 equal pieces. </step>
    <step num="11">Grease a 9-inch (23 cm) square baking dish with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="12">Place the rolls in the pan, with the blueberry roll and 2 raspberry rolls in the top row, 3 cream cheese rolls in the middle row, and 3 raspberry rolls in the bottom row, to look like an American flag. </step>
    <step num="13">Cover the rolls with a kitchen towel and let rise for 1 hour in a warm area, until doubled in size. </step>
    <step num="14">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="15">Bake the rolls for 25 minutes, or until golden brown on top. </step>
    <step num="16">Remove the rolls from the baking dish. </step>
    <step num="17">Microwave the reserved cream cheese filling for about 30 seconds, until pourable. Drizzle on top of the rolls. </step>
    <step num="18">Enjoy! </step>
