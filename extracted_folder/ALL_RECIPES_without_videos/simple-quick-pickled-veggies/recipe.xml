    <step num="1">Fill the jars with vegetables, leaving ½ inch (1 cm) of space at the top. </step>
    <step num="2">Add spices of choice to the jars with the vegetables. We like plain beets, cucumbers with mustard seeds and peppercorns, carrots with ginger and fennel seeds, and red onion with peppercorns. </step>
    <step num="3">In a medium pot over high heat, combine the water, vinegar, sugar, and salt. Stir until the sugar and salt dissolve. Bring to a boil. </step>
    <step num="4">Once boiling, remove the brine from the heat and pour into the jars. Tap the jars against the counter to release any bubbles. </step>
    <step num="5">Close the jars and allow to cool completely at room temperature. </step>
    <step num="6">Refrigerate the jars for 48 hours before eating the pickles. Store for up to 1 week in a refrigerator. </step>
