    <step num="1">Add the marshmallows and stir until melted. Add the crispy rice cereal and stir to coat. </step>

    <step num="3">Using a greased measuring cup, press down into the cereal to form to the pan. Press the edges against the springform pan to create walls. Set aside. </step>

    <step num="9">Refrigerate for 3-4 hours or overnight, until the cheesecake is set. Release the springform. </step>
    <step num="10">Put the remaining cup of whipped cream in a piping bag fitted with a star tip and decorate the top of the cheesecake. </step>
