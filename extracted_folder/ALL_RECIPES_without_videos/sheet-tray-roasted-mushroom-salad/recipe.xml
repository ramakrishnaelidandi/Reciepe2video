  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line 2 baking sheets with reusable baking mats or parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">Spread the cremini mushrooms in an even layer on 1 baking sheet and the shiitake mushrooms on the other. Drizzle ⅓ cup (80 ml) olive oil over the mushrooms, dividing evenly. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Toss well to coat evenly. </step>
    <step num="2">Roast the mushrooms for 20-25 minutes, stirring halfway through, until crisp and tender. Remove from the oven and set aside. Leave the oven on. </step>
    <step num="3">Meanwhile, make the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the mustard, honey, and lemon juice. Slowly drizzle in the remaining ½ cup (120 ml) olive oil, whisking constantly, until the dressing is emulsified and thickened. Season with salt to taste. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">Scatter the peas, shallot, garlic, and lemon zest over the baking sheets with the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper to taste. </step>
    <step num="5">Return the baking sheets to the oven for 5 minutes, until the peas are warmed through and the shallots are softened. </step>
    <step num="6">Sprinkle the roasted vegetables with parsley and set aside to cool slightly. </step>
    <step num="7">Place the arugula in a large serving bowl. Add the vegetables and half of the dressing and toss well. Top with the shaved Parmesan and serve with the remaining dressing on the side. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
