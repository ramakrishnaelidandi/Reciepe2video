  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Heat the oil in an oven-proof skillet. Toss in the bell peppers, onions, salt, pepper, and garlic, and sauté until the veggies have softened, about 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Season the flank steak on both sides with a good pinch of salt and black pepper. </step>
    <step num="3">Sprinkle on the spinach in an even layer and top with the sautéed peppers. </step>
    <step num="4">Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the veggies and tightly wrap the steak into a roll. </step>
    <step num="5">Skewer the steak with toothpicks about 1½ inches (4 cm) apart so that the steak will hold its shape. </step>
    <step num="6">Slice between the toothpicks to create individual steak rolls. </step>
    <step num="7">Heat a few more tablespoons of oil in the skillet. When the oil has begun to smoke slightly, sear the steak rolls until browned, about 2 minutes per side. </step>
    <step num="8">NOTE: To bake the entire steak roll at one time, simply sear each steak roll in a large skillet and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Once each roll has been seared and transferred to the baking sheet, proceed with steps 10-12. </step>
    <step num="9">Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until it has reached desired level of doneness. </step>
    <step num="10">Let the steak rest for 5 minutes before removing toothpicks. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
