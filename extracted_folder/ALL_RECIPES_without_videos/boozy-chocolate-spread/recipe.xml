  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). </step>
    <step num="1">In a single layer, bake the hazelnuts for 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Wrap the hazelnuts in a clean towel and rub vigorously for a few minutes to remove the skins. </step>
    <step num="3">Pour the hazelnuts into a food processor (discarding the skins) and blend on high. </step>
    <step num="4">Slowly add the Irish cream liqueur and the double cream. </step>
    <step num="5">Take off the lid and add the icing sugar, cocoa powder, and melted chocolate, then blend again until smooth. (Unless you have a very good quality food processor, there will be little bits in there - which simply add texture!) </step>
    <step num="6">Transfer into your favourite jar, where it will keep in the fridge for up to 2 weeks! </step>
    <step num="7">Spread on crusty bread and crepes, or stir 1 heaped tablespoon into 250 millilitres (1 cup) of warm milk for an indulgent hot chocolate! </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
