  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a plastic bag, crush the graham crackers finely with the back of a large pot or pan. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine graham crackers, ¼ cup (40g) confectioners’ sugar, salt, and melted butter, stirring until the mixture is the texture of wet sand. </step>
    <step num="2">Dump the graham cracker mixture into a 9×9 inch (23 x 23 cm) baking dish lined with parchment paper. Press the mixture down with your hands to create an even layer. </step>
    <step num="3">Freeze for 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">In a separate bowl, combine cream cheese, 1 cup (160g) confectioner’s sugar, and vanilla, stirring until smooth. </step>
    <step num="5">Spread the cream cheese mixture evenly on top of the graham cracker crust. </step>
    <step num="6">Freeze for one hour. </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer the frozen cheesecake onto a cutting board, peeling away the parchment paper. Slice 1-centimeter-wide (¹⁄₆₄ in) strips horizontally, then vertically, creating little cheesecake cubes. </step>
    <step num="8">In a medium bowl, microwave the chocolate in 20-second intervals, stirring in between, until melted and smooth. </step>
    <step num="9">Dip the cheesecake cubes in the chocolate, dripping off excess, and set them on a tray lined with parchment paper. Repeat with the remaining cubes. </step>
    <step num="10">Freeze for 15 minutes, then serve! </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
