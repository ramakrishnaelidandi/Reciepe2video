  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a bowl, add the heavy cream and condensed milk and whip until soft peaks form. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the cream cheese and mix until smooth. </step>
    <step num="2">Freeze for 3-5 hours. </step>
    <step num="3">Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC). </step>
    <step num="4">Open the tubes of cinnamon rolls and save the frosting for later. </step>
    <step num="5">Cut 3 of the cinnamon rolls in half. </step>
    <step num="6">Unravel the cinnamon roll halves and full cinnamon rolls and roll together the halves with the whole rolls using your hands to create 6 long thin strips. You’ll have one cinnamon roll left over and you can use that to make a small bowl, or save for later! </step>
    <step num="7">Spray an inverted muffin tin with cooking spray and coil the cinnamon roll strip around the outside in order to create a bowl. Be sure to pinch the ridges together in order to prevent the bowl from separating while baking. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake 7-10 minutes, or until the bowls are golden brown. </step>
    <step num="9">In a small bowl, add the icing from the cinnamon roll packages and melt for 20-30 seconds in a microwave. </step>
    <step num="10">Carefully remove the cinnamon roll bowls from the tins and add 2 scoops of ice cream to each bowl. </step>
    <step num="11">Top the ice cream with melted icing and ground cinnamon. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
