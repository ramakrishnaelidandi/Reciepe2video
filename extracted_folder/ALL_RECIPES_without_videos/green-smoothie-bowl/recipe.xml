    <step num="0">Throw all of the ‘base’ ingredients into a blender and whizz until smooth. </step>
    <step num="1">NOTE: You can adapt this entire recipe as much or as little as you like, we chose to make one that looks super green with a somewhat neutral taste to let the toppings bring out the flavor. </step>
    <step num="2">Pour the smoothie into a bowl, and top with your favorite toppings. Our suggested toppings are just that too, suggestions - be as creative as you like here - pecans, flax seeds, sliced peaches - whatever you like. Make a cool design too! </step>
    <step num="3">Enjoy! </step>
