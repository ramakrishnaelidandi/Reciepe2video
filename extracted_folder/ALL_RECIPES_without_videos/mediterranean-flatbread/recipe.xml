  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a medium skillet, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the kale and cook for 3-4 minutes, until semi-wilted. Season with a pinch of salt. </step>
    <step num="1">Add a splash of water and continue to cook for 3-4 minutes until the kale is mostly wilted. </step>
    <step num="2">Add another drizzle of olive oil and the garlic, pine nuts, and red pepper flakes to the pan. Cook for another 3-4 minutes until the garlic is fragrant and the pine nuts are toasted. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the sun-dried tomatoes and cook for 2-3 more minutes until the kale is completely wilted and tender. Transfer the kale mixture to a bowl and set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">In the same pan, add a drizzle of oil from the jar of sun-dried tomatoes. Heat the flatbreads, 1 at a time, for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="5">Transfer the flatbreads to a cutting board and spread with the hummus. Spoon the kale mixture on top and cut into quarters. </step>
    <step num="6">Sprinkle with more red pepper flakes, if desired, and serve. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
