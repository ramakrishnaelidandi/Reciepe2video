  <steps>
    <step num="0">Add half of the sliced peppers and onions to your slow cooker. </step>
    <step num="1">Layer the chicken and coat all sides with taco seasoning. </step>
    <step num="2">Top with garlic, the juice from one lime, and tomatoes (be sure to drain). </step>
    <step num="3">Add the remaining peppers and onions, cover and any remaining lime juice. </step>
    <step num="4">Cook on high for 3-4 hours. </step>
    <step num="5">Remove chicken and cut/shred into slices (chicken left longer will tend to shred more - cook to your preference). </step>
    <step num="6">Return the sliced chicken to the slow cooker to marinate in the juices for about 10 more minutes (on LOW) until ready to serve. </step>
    <step num="7">NOTE: If you find that there is too much liquid, you can remove till there is a desired amount before serving. </step>
    <step num="8">Assemble Fajitas to your liking - we recommend topping with cheese, sour cream, and guacamole! </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
