  <steps>
    <step num="0">Place a chicken breast between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Pound evenly to about ¼-inch (½ cm) thick, then season both sides with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="1">Place 4 snap peas and a few carrot slices at the bottom edge of the chicken, then roll up tightly and wrap in plastic wrap. Repeat with the remaining chicken and vegetables. </step>
    <step num="2">Chill the chicken rolls in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Heat the sesame oil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add the garlic and ginger and cook until they are toasty. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the chicken stock, sugar, chile flakes, rice vinegar, soy sauce, tomato paste, and cornstarch slurry and whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="5">Cook until the sauce coats the back of a spoon and leaves a path when you run your finger through it. Remove from the heat and set aside. </step>
    <step num="6">Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="7">Unwrap the chicken, then roll in the cornstarch until evenly coated. </step>
    <step num="8">Fry two chicken rolls at a time for 5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C). </step>
    <step num="9">Transfer the chicken to a wire rack to drain. If the chicken is not cooked through by the time it is golden brown on the outside, bake in the oven at 325°F (170°C) until that temperature is reached. </step>
    <step num="10">Slice the chicken rolls and serve with rice alongside. Pour the sauce over the chicken and sprinkle with sesame seeds and scallions for garnish. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
