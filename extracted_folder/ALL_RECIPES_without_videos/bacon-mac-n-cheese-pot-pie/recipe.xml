  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large pot or skillet, add 2 cups (470ml) of milk, pasta, salt, and pepper. Bring it to boil, stirring constantly so the milk and pasta do not burn. </step>
    <step num="1">When the liquid is evaporated halfway, add the rest of the milk. Stir until pasta is al dente. Add shredded cheeses and mix until melted. </step>
    <step num="2">Take off the heat to prevent mac ‘n’ cheese from over cooking. </step>
    <step num="3">In a oven-safe ceramic bowl, coat the inside with butter (or oil). Place sliced cheese until the bowl is fully covered. </step>
    <step num="4">Add bacon (or any desired fixins’), and add the pasta to the top. </step>
    <step num="5">Roll or spread out pizza dough to fit the bowl and place over the top. </step>
    <step num="6">In a small bowl, melt butter. Add in garlic powder, salt, and Italian seasoning, then brush on top of dough. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake in a 350°F (180°C) over for 25 minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">Carefully place a plate over the dough and flip the bowl. Use a butter knife or fork to separate from the bowl. </step>
    <step num="9">Sprinkle with parsley for garnish. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
