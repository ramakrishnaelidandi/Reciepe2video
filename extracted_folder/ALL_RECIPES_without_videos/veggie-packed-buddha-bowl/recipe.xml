  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 325°F (170°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Make the dressing: Use a knife to slice off the top third of the head of garlic, just enough so that all of the cloves are exposed but the head remains intact. </step>
    <step num="2">Fill a small ovenproof saucepan with the olive oil and place the garlic bulb, cut side down, in the oil. Cover the pan with a lid and transfer to the oven. </step>
    <step num="3">Bake for 40 minutes, until the garlic has softened and is easily pierced with a paring knife. Let cool. </step>
    <step num="4">Once the garlic and oil have cooled enough to handle, squeeze the cloves out of the garlic skin into a blender. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the salt, pepper, water, lemon juice, and mustard to the blender. Puree until smooth. </step>
    <step num="6">With the blender still running, slowly add the oil from the saucepan in a steady stream. The dressing should be a creamy and slightly thick. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="7">In a medium bowl, season the chicken with turmeric, onion powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Toss until evenly coated. </step>
    <step num="8">Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken to the pan and sauté until firm and cooked through, about 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. </step>
    <step num="9">To build the buddha bowls, divide the rice between 2 serving bowls. Top with shredded cabbage, sliced avocado, turmeric chicken, shredded carrots, halved cherry tomatoes, and green onions and drizzle with roasted garlic dressing. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
