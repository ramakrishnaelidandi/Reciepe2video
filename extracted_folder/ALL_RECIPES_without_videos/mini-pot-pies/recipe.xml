  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Add the oil to a large pot over high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the chicken, and stir until cooked through, about 7 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a bowl. </step>
    <step num="2">Melt butter in the same pot. Add the onions and carrots and stir until softened, about 8 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the flour, stirring to combine. Slowly add the milk and chicken broth, alternating between the two, stirring continuously and bringing to a boil. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the cooked chicken, peas, salt, and pepper, and stir until thoroughly mixed. Remove from heat and let cool. </step>
    <step num="5">Lay out puff pastry sheets and use a small 6-inch (15 cm) bowl to cut circles out of it. </step>
    <step num="6">Place dough circles in a nonstick muffin tin and fill with pot pie mixture. </step>
    <step num="7">Using remaining puff pastry, cut ⅛-inch (3 mm) strips of dough, and make a lattice top for each muffin cup. Brush the lattice tops with the egg. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 15 minutes, until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
