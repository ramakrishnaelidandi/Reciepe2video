  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, egg, and vanilla extract until smooth. </step>
    <step num="1">Add in the strawberry jam and fresh strawberries, and beat until combined. </step>
    <step num="2">Using a spatula or wooden spoon, stir in the pancake mix and flour until fully incorporated. (The dough will be sticky and pink in color.) </step>
    <step num="3">Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and sprinkle the top with more flour. </step>
    <step num="4">Press out dough until it is about half an inch thick. </step>
    <step num="5">With a round cookie cutter, drinking glass, or mason jar lid, cut the dough in as many circles as will fit. In the center of each circle, cut a smaller circle with a cookie cutter or shot glass. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove the cut donuts to another floured surface and gather up excess dough. </step>
    <step num="7">Repeat steps 5 through 7 until all the dough is used up. </step>
    <step num="8">Heat oil in a large pot to 350ºF (180ºC). </step>
    <step num="9">Carefully place a few donuts in the hot oil, being careful not to crowd the pot. </step>
    <step num="10">Once the bottom is browned, flip the donut over in the oil and cook the other side. </step>
    <step num="11">Once both sides are browned, remove the donut and place it on a rack to cool. </step>
    <step num="12">For the frosting: beat cream cheese in a bowl until smooth. Add powdered sugar and continue to beat until fully incorporated, then add vanilla extract, and finally add milk. </step>
    <step num="13">Dunk the tops of the donuts in the frosting and garnish with slices of fresh strawberries. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
