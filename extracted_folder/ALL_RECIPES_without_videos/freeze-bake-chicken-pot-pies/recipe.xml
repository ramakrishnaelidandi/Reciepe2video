  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a deep skillet, melt the butter and cook celery, carrots, and onion until tender. </step>
    <step num="1">Pour in the flour, and mix in well. </step>
    <step num="2">Stirring constantly, add in the milk and chicken broth a little at a time, alternating between the two. Bring to a boil and continue stirring until thickened. </step>
    <step num="3">Add chicken, peas, salt, and pepper, and stir until combined. Remove from heat and cool. </step>
    <step num="4">Roll out pie crust and use the foil pot pie dish as a template. Cut a piece of dough for the bottom of the dish that is about an inch (²¹⁄₂ cm) thicker than the widest rim of the dish, and a piece that is the same size as the rim. (Roll dough back out and repeat to make more pieces.) </step>
    <step num="5">Place the larger piece of crust in the bottom of the foil dish, fill with the cooled pot pie filling, and top with the smaller crust piece. </step>
    <step num="6">Pinch together, then seal together with a fork. Cut 4 small slits in the middle of the crust. </step>
    <step num="7">Cover each pot pie with foil and freeze for up to 2 months. </step>
    <step num="8">To bake from frozen, preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C), and bake for 30 minutes with the foil on top. Remove the foil and bake for another 30 minutes or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
