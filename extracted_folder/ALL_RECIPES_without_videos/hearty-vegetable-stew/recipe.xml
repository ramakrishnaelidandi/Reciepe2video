    <step num="1">Add the onions, carrots, and celery, and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until onions are semi-translucent. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the garlic, rosemary, thyme, pepper, tomato paste, and soy sauce, and cook for 2-3 more minutes, until the herbs are fragrant. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the flour and stir until fully incorporated. Add the wine and stir until mostly absorbed. </step>
