  <steps>
    <step num="0">Heat the oil in a 6-quart (5 ½ L) Dutch oven over high heat until it reaches 375°F (190°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium bowl, combine flour, garlic powder, paprika, pepper, onion powder, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of salt and whisk well. </step>
    <step num="2">In a liquid measuring cup with a spout, whisk together the milk and half of the flour-spice mix. </step>
    <step num="3">Slice the potatoes on a mandolin or with a sharp knife into ¹⁄₁₆-inch (1 mm) thick slices. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the potato slices to a large bowl and cover with water. Move the potato slices around to remove excess starch, then drain the water. </step>
    <step num="5">Sprinkle the potato slices with the remaining 2 tablespoons of salt and toss to coat. </step>
    <step num="6">On a cutting board, slice off the very top and bottom of the onion. </step>
    <step num="7">Cut 8 equal slits into the onion, taking care to leave the onion attached at the root end. </step>
    <step num="8">Place a potato slice between each onion layer. </step>
    <step num="9">Transfer the onion potato lotus onto a spider or fine-mesh strainer. </step>
    <step num="10">Place the spider over a medium bowl and drizzle the spice batter over the lotus. </step>
    <step num="11">Use your fingers to prod between the layers to ensure the batter soaks into the nooks and crannies of the onion. </step>
    <step num="12">Pour the remaining spice mixture over the onion lotus. </step>
    <step num="13">Use your fingers to prod between the layers to ensure even coverage. </step>
    <step num="14">Fry the onion lotus for 10 minutes, or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="15">Transfer the onion lotus onto a wire rack set over a baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="16">Garnish with parsley. </step>
    <step num="17">Serve warm, with ketchup and ranch dressing for dipping. </step>
