  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350ºF (175ºC). </step>
    <step num="1">Open 1 can of dough and mold into balls, roll all of them to about ⅛ -inch (3.2mm) thick. </step>
    <step num="2">Use a 10-inch (25cm) dish or pan to make a circle outline in the dough. </step>
    <step num="3">Spread chocolate-hazelnut spread over the dough staying within the 10 inch (25cm) circle. Repeat this process 2 more times so you have 3 frosted 10-inch (25cm) layers. Pile them on top of each other. Repeat process for final can of dough but do not apply chocolate-hazelnut spread to it, place on top of 3 chocolate-hazelnut layers. </step>
    <step num="4">Use your 10-inch dish or pan once more to cover your 4 layers, use a sharp knife to cut excess dough and make 4 layers into a 10-inch circle. </step>
    <step num="5">Place a cup or mason jar in center of circle and use a sharp knife to cut layered dough into 16 equal parts or “petals”, leaving the center intact. </step>
    <step num="6">Next, Twist 2 petals away from each other, pull them out a bit past other petals and tuck them under themselves, pinching seams. Repeat this process for the rest of the petals. </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer onto baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="8">Whisk egg in small dish and brush star bread with it. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 28-30 minutes or until bread is browned and baked through. </step>
    <step num="10">Let stand for 5 minutes before serving. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
