  <steps>
    <step num="0">Trim the excess fat off the sides of the chicken breast. Using a knife, score the chicken longways, cutting halfway through the chicken to help it cook more rapidly. </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium-sized mixing bowl, crack the eggs and whisk with the milk. </step>
    <step num="2">In a separate medium-sized mixing bowl, add the bread crumbs. </step>
    <step num="3">Dip each chicken breast in the egg mixture, covering it completely, then transfer to the bread crumbs and coat completely. Repeat this process one more time. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="5">Fit a Dutch oven with thermometer and pour in oil for frying. Heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 340˚F (170˚C). </step>
    <step num="6">Set the chicken breasts in, in batches, and fry for 2-3 minutes until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="7">Place fried chicken on a wire rack set over a baking sheet, to drain. Sprinkle with salt. </step>
    <step num="8">Prepare the spicy pepper oil in a small mixing bowl by whisking together all the spices with the sunflower oil, until all the spices have dissolved into the oil. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="9">Transfer the fried chicken to the brioche buns. </step>
    <step num="10">Whisk together the spicy oil so none of the seasoning settles to the bottom. </step>
    <step num="11">Drizzle 2 tablespoons over each chicken breast. </step>
    <step num="12">Add 3 bread and butter pickles on top of the chicken and place the top bun. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
