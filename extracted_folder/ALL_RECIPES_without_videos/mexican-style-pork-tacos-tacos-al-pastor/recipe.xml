  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Slice the pork shoulder into about 1-cm (½ inch) slices, then transfer to a large dish or bowl. </step>
    <step num="2">In a bowl, combine the achiote powder, chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, cumin, salt, pepper, vinegar, and pineapple juice, mashing and stirring until smooth with no lumps. </step>
    <step num="3">Pour the marinade over the pork, then toss the pork slices to make sure that they are all coated on all sides. Wrap the dish/bowl in cling film then marinate the pork for at least 2 hours, up to 3-5 days in the refrigerator. </step>
    <step num="4">On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or foil, place down a slice or two of the pineapple. Take a wooden skewer and push it directly in the middle of the pineapple. </step>
    <step num="5">Remove the pork from the fridge and push the slices through the skewer, layering one after the other until there is a 2-cm (1 inch) gap at the top. Push another pineapple slice on top. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for about an hour and a half, until slightly charred on the outside and deep red. </step>
    <step num="7">Rest the meat for about 10 minutes, then carve off thin slices of the pork. </step>
    <step num="8">Slice off thin pieces of the roasted pineapples as well. </step>
    <step num="9">To assemble and serve, place some pork on the tortillas, followed by a few pieces of pineapple, a sprinkle of onions, a pinch of cilantro, then a small spoonful of the salsa. Top with a squeeze of lime juice (optional). </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
