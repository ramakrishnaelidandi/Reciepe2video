  <steps>
    <step num="0">Line an 8-inch (20 cm) square baking dish with parchment paper to hang over the edges. </step>
    <step num="1">Make the crust: in a medium bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut oil, honey, cinnamon, and salt. Mix with a spatula until smooth. </step>
    <step num="2">Transfer the crust to the baking dish. Use a spatula to smooth the crust into a thin, even layer covering the bottom of the pan. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">Make the filling: open the cans of coconut milk and use a spoon to scoop the thick cream at the top of the can into a medium bowl. Set aside the remaining liquid for another use, such as in smoothies, soups, or sauces. </step>
    <step num="4">Beat the coconut cream with a hand mixer until very fluffy, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the lime juice and honey. Continue to beat until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour the filling over the crust and use a spatula to smooth out the top. </step>
    <step num="7">Top with the lime zest. </step>
    <step num="8">Freeze for at least 2 hours, until the filling has set. </step>
    <step num="9">Grab the parchment on both sides and lift the frozen bar from the baking dish. You may need to use a knife to release the edges or turn the dish upside down on a cutting board and tap on the bottom to release the block. </step>
    <step num="10">Quickly cut the block into 16 2-inch (5-cm) square bars. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
