  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium bowl, mix the ground beef, bread crumbs, parsley, egg, salt, and pepper. </step>
    <step num="2">Pinch off a ball of the mixture, roll between your hands to make ping-pong ball-sized meatballs. </step>
    <step num="3">Cook the meatballs over medium heat, turning to brown each side. Remove from heat and drain on a paper towel. </step>
    <step num="4">Slice the baguette into thirds or fourths (each baguette piece should be roughly the same length of two meatballs). </step>
    <step num="5">Hollow out the insides of the baguette pieces with a knife. </step>
    <step num="6">Lay two slices of mozzarella on top of each other with a 1-inch (2 ½ cm) overlap. Place two meatballs on the overlapping region, then fold the mozzarella tightly around the meatballs. </step>
    <step num="7">Push the rolled meatballs and cheese into a baguette piece. </step>
    <step num="8">Slice the stuffed baguette pieces into 1-inch (2 ½ cm) slices, then place them tightly side-by-side on a baking sheet lined with foil. </step>
    <step num="9">In a small bowl, mix together ingredients for garlic butter. </step>
    <step num="10">Brush the garlic butter evenly over the baguette slices, making sure some drips in between the slices. </step>
    <step num="11">Wrap the foil over the re-assembled baguette and bake for 15–20 minutes, until cheese is melted and the top is starting to brown. </step>
    <step num="12">Remove the foil and serve with marinara. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
