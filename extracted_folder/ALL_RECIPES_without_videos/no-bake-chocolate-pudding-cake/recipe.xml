  <steps>
    <step num="0">Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and grease with nonstick cooking spray. </step>
    <step num="1">Spread the chocolate hazelnut spread into an even rectangle, leaving ¼ inch (6 mm) between each cracker. </step>
    <step num="2">Place 20 graham cracker halves on top of chocolate hazelnut mixture and freeze until solid, about 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Cut between the graham cracker pieces with a knife. Lay a cutting board on top of the graham crackers and invert the baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="4">Carefully peel the parchment paper from the chocolate hazelnut layer. Return to freezer until ready to build cake. </step>
    <step num="5">In a large bowl, combine the instant pudding and milk, and whisk until fully incorporated. Allow to set for at least five minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla, and mix until fully incorporated. </step>
    <step num="7">Fold in the melted chocolate until fully incorporated. </step>
    <step num="8">Add the cream cheese mixture to the pudding mixture and stir until fully combined. </step>
    <step num="9">Add three quarters of the pudding mixture to the bottom of a 10-inch (25-cm) greased springform pan. </step>
    <step num="10">Make a ring along the edge of the pan with the chocolate hazelnut graham crackers pressing them until they are even with the top of the pan. </step>
    <step num="11">Leave a ¼ to ½–inch (2 to 6-cm) gap and make another ring using plain graham cracker pieces. Repeat, alternating between chocolate hazelnut and plain graham crackers, until you reach the center. </step>
    <step num="12">Fill the pan with the remaining pudding mixture and spread evenly across the top. </step>
    <step num="13">Freeze the cake for at least 4 hours. </step>
    <step num="14">Release the chilled cake from the pan and frost with chocolate frosting. </step>
    <step num="15">Garnish with raspberries, crushed graham crackers, and chocolate shavings. </step>
    <step num="16">Enjoy! </step>
