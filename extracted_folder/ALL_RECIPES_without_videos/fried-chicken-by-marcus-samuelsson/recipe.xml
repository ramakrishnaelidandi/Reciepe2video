  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a medium saucepan over high heat, add 2 cups (470 ml) of water and the salt. Bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve all the salt. Remove from heat and pour into a larger pot/container. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the ice water into the pot to cool. Add the chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 1 ½ hours. </step>
    <step num="2">Prepare the chicken shake. In a small bowl, whisk together all the chicken shake ingredients. </step>
    <step num="3">NOTE: Makes about 1 cup (110g) that will keep for 6 months. Store in a jar out of the light. </step>
    <step num="4">In a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking dish, add buttermilk, coconut milk, and garlic. </step>
    <step num="5">Add 1 tablespoon of chicken shake and whisk together. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove the chicken from the saltwater, dab on paper towels to remove excess liquid, then add into the buttermilk marinade. Roll to coat each piece. Cover and refrigerate overnight. </step>
    <step num="7">Fill a large cast iron pan ⅔-full with peanut oil over medium-high heat. Heat to 360˚F (182˚C). </step>
    <step num="8">While the oil is heating, coat the marinated chicken. In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, cornstarch, and white pepper. </step>
    <step num="9">Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off, then roll in the flour mixture, packing it on so the chicken is completely coated. </step>
    <step num="10">Set coated chicken on a wire rack over a baking sheet. If the coating looks damp, roll it in the flour mixture again. </step>
    <step num="11">Working in batches, fry the chicken until it is brown and golden on both sides and reaches an internal temperature of 165˚F (73˚C), about 10 minutes per batch. NOTE: Adjust heat to keep the oil between 350-375˚F (180-190˚C). </step>
    <step num="12">Drain on a rack set over a baking sheet. Rest 8-10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="13">Fry the chicken a second time, only for about 3 minutes, to really crisp up the skin. Drain on a rack. </step>
    <step num="14">Sprinkle with additional chicken shake. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
