  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 325˚F (170˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Mash bananas in a large bowl. Add eggs and combine thoroughly. Then mix in the remaining wet ingredients: greek yogurt, maple syrup, and vanilla. </step>
    <step num="2">Next, add the whole wheat flour and baking powder and mix until fully incorporated. Be careful not to over mix. </step>
    <step num="3">In a medium, microwave-safe bowl, microwave the chocolate chunks in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until melted and smooth. </step>
    <step num="4">Add a large scoop of the banana batter to the bowl of melted chocolate and fold until mixed well. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour the banana batter and the chocolate batter alternately into a greased 9x5-inch (23x13 cm) bread pan. These do not need to be even layers. </step>
    <step num="6">Using a knife or a spoon, gently swirl the batters together. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean from the center of the bread. </step>
    <step num="8">Allow to cool for at least 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
