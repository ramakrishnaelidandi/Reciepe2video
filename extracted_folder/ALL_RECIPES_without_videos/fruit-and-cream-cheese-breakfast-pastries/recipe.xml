  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC), and prepare two cookie sheets with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">In a bowl, mix cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until fully combined. </step>
    <step num="2">Lightly flour the surface and roll out puff pastry on top to flatten. </step>
    <step num="3">Cut each sheet of puff pastry into 9 equal squares. </step>
    <step num="4">On the top right and bottom left of the pastry, cut an L shape approximately ½ inch (1 cm) from the edge. </step>
    <step num="5">NOTE: This L shape should reach all the way down and across the square, however both L shapes should not meet at the ends. Your pastry should look like a picture frame with two corners still intact. </step>
    <step num="6">Take the upper right corner and fold down towards the inner bottom corner. You will now have a diamond shape. </step>
    <step num="7">Place 1 to 2 teaspoons of the cream cheese filling in the middle, then place berries on top. </step>
    <step num="8">Repeat with the remaining pastry squares and place them onto the parchment covered baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 15-20 minutes or until pastry is golden brown and puffed. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
