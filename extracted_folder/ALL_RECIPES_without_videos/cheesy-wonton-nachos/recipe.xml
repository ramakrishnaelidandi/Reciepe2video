  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the beef: Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes more, until softened but not browned. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the beef, cumin, chili powder, oregano, salt, and pepper to the pan. Stir to break up the ground beef, then let sit undisturbed for about 3 minutes to let the meat brown. Stir and continue cooking until no pink remains, 5-7 minutes total. Add 2 tablespoons of the pickled jalapeño liquid and cook until slightly evaporated, about 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat. Drain any excess liquid from beef and set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Make the wontons: In a medium bowl, mix together the American cheese and beef until well combined with large chunks of cheese still intact. </step>
    <step num="3">Fill a large, deep pot about ⅔ of the way with vegetable oil. Heat the oil until it reaches 350°F (180°C). Set a wire rack on top of a baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="4">On a clean work surface, lay out 10 wonton wrappers at a time. Scoop about 2 teaspoons of the beef mixture into the center of each wonton wrapper. Lightly brush 2 edges of the wrapper with egg, then fold up one corner to meet the opposite corner, forming a triangle, and gently press all the edges together to seal, ensuring all the air is pressed out from around the filling. Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers. </step>
    <step num="5">Working in batches, gently lower 4-6 filled wontons into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, flipping once, 2-3 minutes total. Transfer to the wire rack to drain and sprinkle lightly with salt. </step>
    <step num="6">Arrange half of the stuffed wontons on a baking sheet. Cover with ½ cup (50 g) of the shredded cheddar and about half the black beans. Top with the remaining wontons and cheddar cheese. </step>
    <step num="7">Broil the wontons until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">Top the wonton nachos with the remaining black beans, jalapeños, red onion, tomato, sour cream, avocado, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges on the side. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
