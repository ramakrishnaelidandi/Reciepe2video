    <step num="0">Remove all leaves and cut the cauliflower into small florets. </step>
    <step num="1">Place the florets in a food processor and blend until they are a rice-like texture. Be careful not to over process or it may turn mushy. Set aside, and drain excess moisture with a towel, if desired. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, cook onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, salt, and pepper until vegetables are tender but not soft. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the cauliflower rice. Cook for about 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are incorporated evenly into the cauliflower. </step>
    <step num="4">Spread the rice towards the edge of the pan, creating a well in the center. Pour the beaten eggs into the well, stirring only the eggs until they are cooked. </step>
    <step num="5">Fold the eggs into the rice. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
