  <steps>
    <step num="0">Place the gammon joint in a large pot and add the onions and pineapple juice. Bring to a boil over high heat. </step>
    <step num="1">Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium, cover, and simmer for 70 minutes. (Gammon joints need to cook for 40 minutes per kilo (2 ¼ lbs), so if you are using a smaller or large gammon joint, adjust the cooking time accordingly.) </step>
    <step num="2">Once cooked, carefully remove the gammon joint from the pan and place on a baking sheet to cool slightly. </step>
    <step num="3">Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). </step>
    <step num="4">Make the glaze: in a small pan over a medium heat, combine the Dijon mustard, pineapple juice, and maple syrup and bring to a boil. Cook for 10 minutes, or until slightly reduced and glossy. </step>
    <step num="5">Carefully remove the skin from the gammon joint, using a small paring knife to help ease the fat away from the skin. Be sure to leave a small layer of fat on top of the gammon. </step>
    <step num="6">Score the fat in a diamond pattern and push a clove into each cross section. </step>
    <step num="7">Liberally brush the gammon joint with the glaze, making sure to reserve at least half of the glaze. </step>
    <step num="8">Roast the gammon joint for 40 minutes, glazing again halfway through. </step>
    <step num="9">Carve and serve. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
