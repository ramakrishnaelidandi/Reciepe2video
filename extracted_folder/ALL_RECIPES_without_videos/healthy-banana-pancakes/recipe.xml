  <steps>
    <step num="0">Mash bananas in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in eggs and vanilla until well combined, then mix in oats and cinnamon. </step>
    <step num="1">Heat a skillet to medium and add in a scoop* of the pancake batter. Smooth out to form an even layer. Cook for about 2-3 minutes until you start to see bubbles releasing from the top of the batter. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 1-2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Garnish your pancakes with your favorite toppings! We used banana slices, chopped walnuts &amp; maple syrup. </step>
    <step num="3">Enjoy! </step>
    <step num="4">*Note: Use ½ cup for scooping the batter to yield 4 thicker pancakes; Use ⅓ cup to yield 6 smaller pancakes. </step>
