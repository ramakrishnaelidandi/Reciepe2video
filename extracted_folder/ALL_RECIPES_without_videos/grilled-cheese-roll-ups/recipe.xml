  <steps>
    <step num="0">Cut crust off the slices of bread. This makes the bread easier to roll and will hold the shape better. </step>
    <step num="1">Flatten slices of bread with a rolling pin. </step>
    <step num="2">Layer the slices of cheese on top of each slice of bread so that the cheese is offset from the bread by about 1 inch (2 ½ cm) vertically. Other fillings can be added here if desired. </step>
    <step num="3">Roll each slice of bread with cheese vertically as tightly as possible without cracking the bread. Gently squeeze each roll to maintain its shape and set down on its seam. </step>
    <step num="4">Melt the butter in a pan. Grill each roll starting with the seam side down on the hot pan. </step>
    <step num="5">Rotate so that all sides are evenly golden brown. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
