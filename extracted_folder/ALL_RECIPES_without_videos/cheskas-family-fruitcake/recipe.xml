    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 300˚F (150˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a small bowl, combine the raisins and sweet red wine. Let sit for at least 10 minutes, until the raisins absorb some of the wine. </step>
    <step num="2">In a medium bowl, use an electric hand mixer to beat the egg whites until medium peaks form. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large bowl, use an electric hand mixer to cream together the butter and sugar. Add the egg yolks and beat until incorporated. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the salt to the flour, then gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, beating until just incorporated. </step>
    <step num="5">Using a rubber spatula, fold in the soaked raisins, walnuts, and glazed fruit until just combined. </step>
    <step num="6">Gently fold in the egg whites. </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer the batter to a 9x5-inch (23x13 cm) loaf pan and smooth the top. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 2 hours 15 minutes to 2 hours 30 minutes, until a skewer inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool. </step>
    <step num="9">Serve immediately or wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 7 days. </step>
