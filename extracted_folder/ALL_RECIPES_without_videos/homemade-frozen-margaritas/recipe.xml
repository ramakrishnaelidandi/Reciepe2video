  <steps>
    <step num="0">Combine the tequila, limeade (or lemonade), and orange juice in your dish, give it a stir. </step>
    <step num="1">Pop it in the freezer for at least five hours. Once it’s frozen into a solid, you’re ready to serve </step>
    <step num="2">Take it out of the freezer and, using a spoon, scrape along the surface to pull up beautiful shards of frozen margarita (the motion is somewhere between scooping up ice cream and scraping off a car windshield in winter). </step>
    <step num="3">Feel free to play around with the ratio on this — it’ll work with a bit less tequila and more juice, or a bit more tequila and less juice (whatever kind of party you’re looking for). Salted rim totally optional. </step>
    <step num="4">Enjoy! </step>
