  <steps>
    <step num="0">Wrap a 10-inch (25 cm) freezer-safe bowl in plastic wrap. Scoop the vanilla ice cream into the bowl, and using a spatula smooth the ice cream to form an even layer. Freeze for 1 hour, or until frozen. </step>
    <step num="1">Remove the bowl from the freezer, and scoop the strawberry ice cream onto the frozen vanilla layer. Using a spatula, smooth the strawberry ice cream to form an even layer. Freeze for 1 hour, or until frozen. </step>
    <step num="2">After the strawberry layer is frozen, repeat with chocolate ice cream. </step>
    <step num="3">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="4">In a bowl, add the eggs and sugar and whisk until well combined. </step>
    <step num="5">Add 1 egg and mix until combined. Repeat with remaining eggs, mixing after each egg is added. </step>
    <step num="6">Alternate adding a little bit of flour and milk, whisking after each addition until combined. Repeat until the flour and milk have been used up. The batter should be smooth and creamy. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract and whisk until well combined. </step>
    <step num="8">Pour the batter into a greased and floured 10-inch (25 cm) cake tin. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until the top is golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean. </step>
    <step num="10">Let the cake cool completely. Once cool, invert the cake onto a plate and set aside. </step>
    <step num="11">Bring a pan of water to a simmer over medium heat. </step>
    <step num="12">Place a heatproof bowl over the simmering water, and add the egg whites, sugar, and cream of tartar. Whisk constantly until the sugar has dissolved and the egg white mixture is warm, about 3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="13">Remove the bowl from the pan. Using a hand mixer, beat the egg white mixture until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 10 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and mix until just combined. </step>
    <step num="14">Remove the bowl of ice cream from the freezer and gently invert it onto the cake, creating a dome shape. Remove the plastic wrap from the ice cream. </step>
    <step num="15">Working quickly, use a spatula to spread a layer of meringue over the entire cake and ice cream dome so that it’s fully coated. </step>
    <step num="16">Using a kitchen torch, brown the peaks of meringue. </step>
    <step num="17">Serve immediately. </step>
    <step num="18">Enjoy! </step>
