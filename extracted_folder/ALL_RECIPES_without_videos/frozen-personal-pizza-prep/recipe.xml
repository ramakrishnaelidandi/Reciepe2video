  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Place a parchment paper-lined baking sheet in the oven. </step>
    <step num="2">To make four personal-sized pizzas, divide pizza dough into fourths. </step>
    <step num="3">Roll out each piece of dough to desired thickness. </step>
    <step num="4">To par-bake the pizza rounds, arrange the pizza dough rounds on the hot baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 3-4 minutes or until dough looks puffy and dry. Dough should not be golden brown. </step>
    <step num="6">Cool pizza rounds on a wire rack. </step>
    <step num="7">When cool, top your rounds with desired toppings. </step>
    <step num="8">Place prepared pizzas on a baking sheet and freeze, uncovered, for 3 hours so the toppings adhere to one another. </step>
    <step num="9">Wrap the now-frozen pizzas in plastic wrap and aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn. Label each pizza as desired and freeze for 1-2 months. </step>
    <step num="10">To bake frozen pizzas, preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). </step>
    <step num="11">Unwrap pizza and place directly on rack or parchment-lined baking sheet. </step>
