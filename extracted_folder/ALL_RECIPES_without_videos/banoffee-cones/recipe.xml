  <steps>
    <step num="0">Fold a 45cm (17 ¾ inch) long rectangle of aluminum foil into triangles until you have a triangle with a longest side of 10-12 cm (4-4 ¾ inch). Form this triangle into a cone. Make as many aluminum cones as you want. </step>
    <step num="1">Cut a sheet of puff pastry into 2.5cm (1 inch) strips. </step>
    <step num="2">Wrap the pastry around an aluminum cone so that it overlaps by about 1 cm (⅓ inch). Press the tail of the pastry onto itself so that it sticks. </step>
    <step num="3">Lay this seam face down on a baking sheet and brush with egg wash. Bake for 18-20 minutes at 180°C (350°F). </step>
    <step num="4">Whip the double cream. Reserve 2-3 large scoops of whipped cream. </step>
    <step num="5">Mix the remaining whipped cream with the toffee sauce. </step>
    <step num="6">Scoop mixture into a plastic bag for piping. </step>
    <step num="7">Peel and slice banana. </step>
    <step num="8">Remove aluminum cone. </step>
    <step num="9">Pipe cones by alternating 2cm (¾ inch) of toffee cream and 1 slice of banana. Top with a swirl of reserved cream and a vertical banana slice. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
