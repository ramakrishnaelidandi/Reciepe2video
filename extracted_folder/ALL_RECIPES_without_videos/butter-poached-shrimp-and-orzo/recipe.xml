    <step num="0">Over low heat, add water to your saucepan and slowly incorporate the butter, a few tablespoons at a time. Whisk together to make sure the water and butter combine and doesn’t separate. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the lemon zest and sprig of thyme and give it a stir. Add the shrimp and poach for eight to 10 minutes. Remove shrimp and set aside. Discard the sprig of thyme. </step>
    <step num="2">In the same saucepan and over low heat, add garlic, shallots and the orzo. Salt and pepper to taste. Stir until all the liquid has been absorbed. </step>
    <step num="3">Pour in the chicken stock and cook until the orzo is al dente. Stir occasionally to make sure nothing is sticking to the bottom of the saucepan. </step>
    <step num="4">Once the orzo is al dente, add the spinach. Stir in until just wilted. Remove from heat. </step>
    <step num="5">Serve the spinach and orzo, place a few shrimps on top and garnish with chopped parsley. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
