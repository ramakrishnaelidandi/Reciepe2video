  <steps>
    <step num="0">For the slow cooker carnitas: Combine the spices in a bowl and rub all over the pork shoulder. </step>
    <step num="1">In your slow cooker, place onions and jalapeños. Place pork shoulder on top of the onions and jalapeños. Add the lime juice, orange juice and garlic cloves. </step>
    <step num="2">Cover and cook low for 8 hours or high for 4 hours. </step>
    <step num="3">For the buns: Dissolve instant yeast, sugar and warm water in a small bowl. Let it proof/activate for 5 minutes or until bubbly or foamy. </step>
    <step num="4">Sift together the dry ingredients (flour, salt and baking powder). </step>
    <step num="5">Add the yeast mix to the dry ingredients, knead to form ball of dough. </step>
    <step num="6">Place ball of dough into greased bowl, cover and proof dough for 1 hour or until double in size. </step>
    <step num="7">Punch down dough, roll out and cut into golf ball sized pieces. Cover and rest the golf ball sized dough balls for 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">When slow cooker carnitas are done, pull apart with a fork and transfer to a separate bowl. Keep the juices in the slow cooker and use it for a dipping sauce later. </step>
    <step num="9">When ready, prepare your steamer over high heat. </step>
    <step num="10">Flatten each dough ball, add about a tablespoon of pulled carnitas to the center and pull the sides of the dough around the filling. </step>
    <step num="11">Place seam side down on a piece of parchment paper. Steam for 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="12">Serve with the slow cooker juices as a dipping sauce. If the dipping sauce has too much fat, skim the fat. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
