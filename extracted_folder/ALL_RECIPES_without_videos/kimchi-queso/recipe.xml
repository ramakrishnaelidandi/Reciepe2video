  <steps>
    <step num="0">Chop kimchi and place in bowl, set aside. </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium saucepan, melt cheddar cheese part way (until it’s mostly soft but still clumpy). </step>
    <step num="2">Add the sour cream. Melt and stir until the mixture is smooth. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the red pepper powder and stir until evenly integrated. </step>
    <step num="4">Add kimchi and simmer until evenly mixed and smooth. The liquid from the kimchi may give the appearance that the queso is chunky, continue heating and stirring 5-10 minutes and it will smooth out. </step>
    <step num="5">Serve garnished with chopped green onion. Goes great with chips, raw vegetables, or straight into the mouth via spoon. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
