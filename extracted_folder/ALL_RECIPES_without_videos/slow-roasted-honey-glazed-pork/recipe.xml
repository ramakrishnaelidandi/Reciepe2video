  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 275ºF (140°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine 1 cup (235 ml) of the soy sauce with the sugar, garlic, and scallions, stirring until mixed. </step>
    <step num="2">Score the skin of the pork by slicing a crosshatch pattern through the skin down to the meat. This will help excess fat render out and allow more of the marinade to soak in. </step>
    <step num="3">Place the pork in the marinade and toss to coat evenly. Marinate for one hour. </step>
    <step num="4">On a baking sheet, place the asparagus halves to the right and diced potatoes to the left. Toss the vegetables with the oil, salt, and pepper. Place the marinated pork in the middle of the baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake 1 to 1 ½ hours, depending on the weight of the pork. </step>
    <step num="6">Raise the heat of the oven to 500ºF (260ºC). </step>
    <step num="7">In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, honey, and remaining soy sauce, stirring until smooth. </step>
    <step num="8">Spoon the honey glaze over the top of the pork, making sure to fill the cracks and crevices on top. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 20 minutes until sugar is dark brown and caramelized, and the top of the pork is crispy. </step>
    <step num="10">Remove the vegetables and pork from the tray, making sure to save all the juices. </step>
    <step num="11">Slice the pork into ½-inch (2 ½ cm) slices, and plate with the roasted vegetables. Spoon the reserved pan juices on top of the pork. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
