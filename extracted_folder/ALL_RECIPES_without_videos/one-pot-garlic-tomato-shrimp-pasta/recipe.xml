  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a 6-quart Dutch oven, bring 4 quarts of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. </step>
    <step num="1">Add spaghetti, cooking about 6-7 minutes until al dente. Drain and set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Return the Dutch oven to the stovetop and heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the shrimp, salt, and ½ teaspoon of the red pepper flakes. Spread evenly across the bottom of the pot and cook until the bottoms pink and slightly brown, about 45-60 seconds. Flip and repeat until shrimp are just cooked through. </step>
    <step num="4">Remove the shrimp and place in a small bowl to the side. </step>
    <step num="5">Reduce heat to medium-low, and add additional 1 tablespoon of oil to the pot, as needed. </step>
    <step num="6">Add onion and garlic to the oil and cook until onions have softened, about 3-5 minutes. Stir frequently to ensure the garlic does not burn. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the diced tomatoes, remaining 1 teaspoon of salt, sugar, remaining 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, oregano, and white wine. </step>
    <step num="8">Stir and bring the sauce up to a simmer. Simmer for 5-10 minutes until the sauce has thickened. </step>
    <step num="9">Return the shrimp (and any accumulated juices) to the sauce. Add the parsley, stirring to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="10">Add the cooked spaghetti back into the pot, toss until evenly coated and heated, then remove from heat. Serve immediately. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
