  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine the rice, onion, carrot, scallions, ginger, garlic, salt, rice vinegar, soy sauce, and eggs. Mix thoroughly. </step>
    <step num="2">Add ¼ cup (30 grams) of the rice mixture to each cup of the prepared muffin tin. Use your fingers to press the rice around the sides of the cups, making indentations in the center. </step>
    <step num="3">Bake for 35 minutes, until the cups have started to pull away from the pan and the edges are golden brown. </step>
    <step num="4">Meanwhile, make the teriyaki chicken: In a large skillet over medium heat, add the olive oil, chicken, and salt. Cook until the chicken is no longer visibly pink, about 3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the garlic and ginger and stir. Add the soy sauce, honey, sesame seeds, cornstarch, and lime juice. Cook the sauce until thickened, about 4 minutes, stirring often. Remove the pan from the heat. </step>
    <step num="6">Let rice cups cool slightly, then remove them from the muffin tin. </step>
    <step num="7">Place 3-4 pieces of chicken in each cup, spoon some sauce over the top, and garnish with chopped scallions. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve immediately. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
