  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">Gently lay the rolled-out pie crust in a pie dish. Trim the excess dough around the sides. </step>
    <step num="2">Tuck the dough under the edge, and crimp the edges using the index finger knuckle on one hand and the thumb and index finger on your other hand. Chill in the refrigerator for 14-20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">After chilling the crust, crumple a piece of parchment paper, then spread it out in the center of the crust. Add dried chickpeas or baking beans to the center and spread toward the sides of the crust--this will add weight to keep the crust from puffing up and hold up the walls. </step>
    <step num="4">Bake the crust for 15-20 minutes, until slightly golden and there are no raw doughy spots. </step>
    <step num="5">Cut the sugar pumpkin into 8 wedges. Use a paring knife or spoon remove all of the seeds and pulp. </step>
    <step num="6">Place the pumpkin on the prepared baking sheet and dry roast for 15-20 minutes, until tender. </step>
    <step num="7">Let the pumpkin cool slightly, then peel off the skin using your hands or a spoon. </step>
    <step num="8">Increase the oven temperature to 425˚F (220˚C). </step>
    <step num="9">Add 16 ounces (455 g) of the pumpkin to a food processor, along with the cinnamon, allspice, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, salt, vanilla, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, egg yolk, and half-and-half. Puree until very smooth, 6-8 minutes. </step>
    <step num="10">Pour the filling into the prebaked crust. Brush the edges of the crust with egg wash. </step>
    <step num="11">Bake the pie for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350˚F (180˚C) and continue to bake for 30-35 minutes more, until the edges are set but the center still jiggles slightly when shaken. </step>
    <step num="12">Let cool at room temp for at least 2 hours, or in the fridge overnight </step>
    <step num="13">Slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
