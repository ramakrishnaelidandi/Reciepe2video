  <steps>
    <step num="0">Add the potatoes to a bowl of cold water to remove excess starch and prevent discoloration. </step>
    <step num="1">Pour oil to a depth of 6 inches (15 cm) in a large heavy pot. Heat over medium-high heat until oil reaches 325˚F (160˚C). </step>
    <step num="2">Drain the potatoes and blot dry thoroughly with paper towels. </step>
    <step num="3">Working in batches, fry the potatoes in the hot oil for about 5 minutes, or until pale golden. With a slotted spoon or spider, transfer to a wire rack to drain. Season with salt. </step>
    <step num="4">Increase the heat to high. When the oil temperature reaches 375˚F (190˚C), return the fries to the pot and fry until golden brown. Transfer to the rack to drain again and season with more salt. </step>
    <step num="5">Reduce the heat to medium-high to let the oil temperature reduce to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="6">Pat the cod fillets dry with a paper towel. Season all over with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="7">Add 1 cup (125 G) of flour to a plate. Dredge the cod in the flour, shaking off any excess. </step>
    <step num="8">In a large bowl, whisk to combine the remaining 1½ cups (185 G) of flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and baking powder. Gradually add the beer, whisking until smooth. </step>
    <step num="9">Dip the dredged cod in the batter, turning to coat completely. </step>
    <step num="10">Fry the cod in the hot oil until golden brown on all sides, 3-5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain for 3 minutes. Season with salt. </step>
    <step num="11">Garnish the fish and chips with parsley and serve with lemon wedges, tartar sauce, ketchup, and malt vinegar. </step>
