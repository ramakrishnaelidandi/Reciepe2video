  <steps>
    <step num="0">Add coconut butter and maple syrup to a saucepan over medium heat. </step>
    <step num="1">Cook for 2-3 minutes while stirring constantly. The mixture should start out smooth then thicken into a dense paste. </step>
    <step num="2">Add peanut butter and vanilla extract to the saucepan and stir to incorporate. Continue to cook for an additional 2-4 minutes until the mixture achieves a smooth and pourable texture. </step>
    <step num="3">Remove the peanut butter mixture from the heat and allow it to cool slightly. </step>
    <step num="4">While the mixture cools, break up the baking bar of chocolate into a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it for 1 minute (stirring every 15 seconds) or until it is completely melted and smooth. </step>
    <step num="5">Prepare a 9x9-inch (23x23 cm) baking tray by spraying it with nonstick cooking spray and layering it with a piece of parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour half of the peanut butter mixture into the baking tray and spread it out evenly. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the melted chocolate to the remaining peanut butter mixture and mix thoroughly. </step>
    <step num="8">Once incorporated, layer the chocolate mixture into the baking tray, over top of the peanut butter layer, and spread it evenly. </step>
    <step num="9">Give the tray a few shakes and taps to remove any possible air bubbles and place the tray in the freezer for 1.5-2 hours to set. </step>
    <step num="10">Turnover the baking tray to remove the fudge. Cut into small rectangular pieces before serving. </step>
    <step num="11">NOTE: Fudge should be stored in the refrigerator until ready to serve. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
