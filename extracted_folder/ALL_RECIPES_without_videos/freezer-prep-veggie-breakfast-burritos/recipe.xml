  <steps>
    <step num="0">Heat a large skillet over medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil. Add the onion and cook for 3 minutes, or until translucent. Add the bell peppers and mushrooms and season with salt. Sauté for 1-2 minutes, then cover and cook for 5 minutes, until the peppers and mushrooms are softened. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the kale and cook until wilted. Remove the veggies from the pan and set aside. Wipe out the pan. </step>
    <step num="2">In a bowl, combine the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper. Whisk to combine. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">Heat another drizzle of olive oil in the clean pan. Add the eggs and cook until scrambled to your liking. Remove from the heat. </step>
    <step num="4">Lay a tortilla on a clean work surface. Add about ⅛ of the eggs and cooked vegetables, 2 ounces of beans, and ½ tablespoon each of the cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses to the center. Fold in the sides of the tortilla, then roll into a burrito. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. </step>
    <step num="5">Heat a clean skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the burritos on both sides, starting with the seam side, until the tortilla is brown and crisp. </step>
    <step num="6">Wrap the burritos individually in foil or reusable beeswax wraps. They will keep in the freezer for up to 3 weeks. </step>
    <step num="7">When ready to eat, unwrap a burrito and microwave for 3 minutes. Serve with salsa. </step>
