  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Unroll the dough, it should form 15x9-inch (38x22 cm) rectangle, then cut the rectangle horizontally into three equal strips. (These will be your three pretzels.) </step>
    <step num="2">Carefully stretch each of the strips by width and length — stretch each to about 3 inch (7 ½ cm) width and about 34 inch (86 cm) length. </step>
    <step num="3">Sprinkle 1 cup (100g) of cheese down the center of each dough strip. Reserve the last 1 cup (100g) of cheese for later. </step>
    <step num="4">Fold the dough over the cheese, pressing to seal and rolling slightly to create 3 dough logs filled with cheese. </step>
    <step num="5">Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray with vegetable oil. </step>
    <step num="6">To form the pretzels, take one dough log, move it to the foil covered baking sheet, then form a circle with the ends of the log at the top of the circle. Twist the log ends around each other once and bring them down to meet the bottom of the circle. Repeat with the other two dough logs. </step>
    <step num="7">Wrap pepperonis on the pretzels — 5-ish per pretzel — then sprinkle the remaining cup of cheese among the three pretzels. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake 14-18 minutes until deep golden brown. </step>
    <step num="9">Serve immediately with pizza sauce for dipping. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
