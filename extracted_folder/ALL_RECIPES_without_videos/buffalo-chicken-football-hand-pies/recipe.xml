  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat to oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine the chicken, salt, pepper, mozzarella cheese, green onions, buffalo sauce, and ranch dressing. </step>
    <step num="2">Roll out the pie crusts on a lightly floured surface to about ¼-inch (6 mm) thick. </step>
    <step num="3">Using a paring knife, cut thin strips to resemble football laces. Then, cut out small football shapes from the remaining dough. Reroll any excess dough and cut out more shapes. You should have about 48 footballs total. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer 24 football shapes to the prepared baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="5">Spoon a heaping tablespoon of the chicken filling into the center of each football, leaving about a ½-inch (1 cm) border around the edges. </step>
    <step num="6">Brush the edges with egg wash and place another football on top, pressing the edges with your finger. Crimp the edges with a fork to seal. </step>
    <step num="7">Arrange the lace cutouts on top of the footballs. Brush more egg wash over the tops. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="9">Let cool for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with ranch dressing, if desired. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
