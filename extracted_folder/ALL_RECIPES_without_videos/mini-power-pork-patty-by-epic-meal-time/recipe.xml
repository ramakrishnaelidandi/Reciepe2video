  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C) and pre-cook all ingredients except for the ground pork and bacon. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, season the ground pork with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, and paprika. Add the egg and mix until just combined. </step>
    <step num="2">Line a loaf pan with parchment paper and place ⅔ of the ground pork mixture into the pan. Push down in the center and up the sides to make a well, making sure to keep the walls pretty thick. You don’t have to use the whole loaf pan. </step>
    <step num="3">Place the pork chop, halved breakfast sausage links, deli ham, breakfast sausage patties, pulled pork, and smoked sausage link inside the well. </step>
    <step num="4">Flatten the remaining ⅓ of the ground pork and place on top as a “lid”. Seal the edges well. Bake for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">On a large piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap, weave together the bacon strips until you have a bacon lattice twice as long and twice as wide as the pork loaf. </step>
    <step num="6">Place the pork loaf in the middle of the bacon weave and wrap the bacon around it. Tuck any excess bacon underneath the loaf. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for another 30 minutes, or until the bacon is crispy. Let rest for 10 minutes before cutting. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
