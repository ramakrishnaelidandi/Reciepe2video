  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, coconut sugar, and salt. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the butter and use a pastry cutter to work it into the flour mixture, until the butter becomes about the size of peas. Work quickly to keep the dough cold. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the ice water 1 tablespoon at a time and mix thoroughly until dough becomes crumbly and just hydrated enough to hold together. </step>
    <step num="3">Dump the mixture onto a floured surface and form the dough into a disc with your hands. Cover and chill for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Meanwhile, make the filling: combine the peaches, blueberries, lemon zest, coconut sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, cardamom, and vanilla in a large bowl and mix well. Cover and chill while the dough chills. </step>
    <step num="5">Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C). </step>
    <step num="6">On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a circle about ¼- to ½-inch (6 to 13 mm) thick. </step>
    <step num="7">Carefully use the rolling pin to transfer the dough to a 10- or 12-inch (25 cm or 30 cm) cast-iron skillet. Gently press the dough against the bottom and sides of the pan. </step>
    <step num="8">Add the filling to the center, then fold the edges of the crust in. </step>
    <step num="9">Brush the edges of the crust with egg wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar, if desired. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="11">Serve warm or at room temperature, with ice cream, if desired. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
