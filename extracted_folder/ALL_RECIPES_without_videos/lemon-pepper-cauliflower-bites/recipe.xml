  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Break the head of cauliflower into bite-sized florets. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, combine olive oil, salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the cauliflower and coat well. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer cauliflower to an oiled, parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Remove from oven and squeeze the juice of one lemon over the florets. Adding the lemon juice in the beginning prevents the cauliflower from getting soggy. Top with some more cracked pepper if you prefer. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for another 10 minutes or until heated through. </step>
    <step num="7">Serve with aioli or your favorite dipping sauce. </step>
