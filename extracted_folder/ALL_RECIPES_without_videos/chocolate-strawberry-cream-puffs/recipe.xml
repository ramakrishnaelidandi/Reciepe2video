  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Cut the tops off the strawberries and cut into pieces. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">In a pot over low heat, combine egg yolks, heavy cream, sugar, and cornstarch. Turn the heat up to medium-high, whisking constantly to prevent any lumps. </step>
    <step num="3">Once the mixture starts to thicken, add in the strawberries, stirring until smooth. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the cream mixture into a bowl, covering the top with plastic wrap and pressing the wrap down onto the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Chill. </step>
    <step num="5">In a pot, combine the water and butter, bringing it to a boil. Add the flour and stir until the dough comes together in a ball. Remove from heat. </step>
    <step num="6">Add in the vanilla and eggs one a time, stirring until the dough becomes a paste. Transfer the dough into a piping bag with a large round tip. </step>
    <step num="7">On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, pipe 1-inch (2½ cm) mounds. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 20 minutes until the pastry has risen considerably and the insides are dry. </step>
    <step num="9">Transfer the chilled pastry cream into a piping bag with a small tip. Poke a hole in the center of the bottom of each cream puff and fill each puff with the pastry cream. </step>
    <step num="10">Microwave the chocolate at 30-second intervals until smooth. Mix in coconut oil if using. </step>
    <step num="11">Dip the top of each filled cream puff into the chocolate, dripping off any excess. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
