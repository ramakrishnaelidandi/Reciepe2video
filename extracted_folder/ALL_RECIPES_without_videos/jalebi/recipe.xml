  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the yogurt and ¼ teaspoon of cardamom. </step>
    <step num="2">Add ½ cup (120 ml) of water and the orange food coloring. The batter should have the consistency of a thick pancake batter. Add more water if needed. </step>
    <step num="3">Cover and let rest in a warm place for 10-12 hours to ferment, or until small bubbles develop on top of the batter. </step>
    <step num="4">Once the batter has fermented, add the sugar and ½ cup (120 ml) of water to a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the remaining ¼ teaspoon of cardamom, the saffron strands, and lemon juice. </step>
    <step num="6">Simmer until a sticky syrup develops, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Whisk the batter and add a tablespoon of water if the batter looks too thick. Transfer to a squeeze bottle or piping bag. </step>
    <step num="8">Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low until it reaches 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="9">Squeeze the batter into the hot oil, making small circular spiral shapes. </step>
    <step num="10">Increase the heat to medium-high. </step>
    <step num="11">Fry the dough shapes until they are crispy on both sides, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="12">Remove and immediately dip in the syrup mixture. </step>
    <step num="13">Serve with rabri, if desired. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
