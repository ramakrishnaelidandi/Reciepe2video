  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line an 8-inch square baking dish with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">Chop the chocolate into chunks. Melt half of the chocolate in the microwave in 20-second intervals, saving the other half for later. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, mix the butter and sugar with an electric hand mixer, then beat in the eggs and vanilla for 1-2 minutes, until the mixture becomes fluffy and light in color. </step>
    <step num="3">Whisk in the melted chocolate (make sure it's not too hot or else the eggs will cook), then sift in the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Fold to incorporate the dry ingredients, being careful not to overmix as this will cause the brownies to be more cake-like in texture. </step>
    <step num="4">Fold in the chocolate chunks, then transfer the batter to the prepared baking dish. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 20-25 minutes, depending on how fudgy you like your brownies, then cool completely. </step>
    <step num="6">Slice, then serve with a nice cold glass of milk! </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
