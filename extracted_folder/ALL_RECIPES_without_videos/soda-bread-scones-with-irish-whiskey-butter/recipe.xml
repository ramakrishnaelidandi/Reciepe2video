  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring the whiskey to a simmer. Turn off the heat, add the raisins, and set aside for at least 15 minutes to allow the raisins to plump. </step>
    <step num="1">Drain and reserve the raisins and whiskey separately. </step>
    <step num="2">Preheat the oven to 400°F (200˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and fine sea salt. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the butter and use your hands to pinch together the butter and flour mixture until coarse crumbs form. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the buttermilk to the mixture and mix just until a dough begins to form. Add the whiskey-soaked raisins and 1½ teaspoons of caraway seeds. Mix just to combine. </step>
    <step num="6">Shape the dough into a 7-inch (18 cm) round. Use a pastry brush to brush the top of the round with buttermilk. Sprinkle with the remaining ½ teaspoon caraway seeds and flaky salt </step>
    <step num="7">Cut the dough into 8 triangles and transfer to the parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing the scones 2 inches (5 cm) apart. Bake until golden, 20 to 25 minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">While the scones bake, make the whiskey butter: In a medium bowl, add the reserved whiskey to the butter, a little at a time, mixing after each addition until fully combined. Stir in the salt. </step>
    <step num="9">Serve the scones warm or at room temperature with the whiskey butter alongside. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
