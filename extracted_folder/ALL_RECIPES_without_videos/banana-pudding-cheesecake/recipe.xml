  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease a 10-inch (25 cm) springform pan with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="1">Make the banana bread crust: Set aside 7 vanilla wafers, then add the rest to a zip-top plastic bag and pound with a rolling pin into fine crumbs. </step>
    <step num="2">Transfer the crushed wafers to a medium bowl, add the melted butter, and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="3">Pour the crust into the prepared pan and press against the bottom to about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick with a flat-bottomed measuring cup. </step>
    <step num="4">In a large bowl, mash the bananas with a fork until smooth. Add the sugar, oil, egg, vanilla, salt, flour, and baking powder. Beat with an electric hand mixer until well-combined. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour the banana bread mixture over the crust and spread evenly with a spatula. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. </step>
    <step num="7">Make the cheesecake filling: In a large bowl, combine the milk, gelatin, and banana pudding mix. Beat with an electric hand mixer until thick and smooth. </step>
    <step num="8">Add the sugar, vanilla, and cream cheese, and beat again until well-combined. </step>
    <step num="9">Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. </step>
    <step num="10">Pour the cheesecake filling over the banana bread crust. </step>
    <step num="11">Bake for 1 hour, then turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake in the oven. Prop the oven door open slightly with a kitchen towel to let the hot air slowly escape. After 2 hours, remove the cheesecake from the oven. Refrigerate overnight. </step>
    <step num="12">Arrange the sliced bananas on top of the cheesecake. Release the springform, then pipe whipped cream on top of 7 of the bananas. Place the reserved vanilla wafer cookies on top of the whipped cream. </step>
    <step num="13">Slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
