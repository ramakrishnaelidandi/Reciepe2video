  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a food processor, blend carrots, cauliflower, broccoli, garlic, egg, onion powder, salt, and pepper until combined. </step>
    <step num="1">Add 1¼ cup (145 grams) of bread crumbs and blend just until incorporated. </step>
    <step num="2">Scoop a tablespoon of the mixture and form a small circular-shaped “nugget.” </step>
    <step num="3">Place the remaining ½ cup (60 grams) of bread crumbs in a bowl and cover each nugget with the bread crumbs. </step>
    <step num="4">Pan fry with a small drizzle of oil over medium-high heat until both sides are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Or, you can bake them on a piece of parchment paper at 400˚F (200˚C) for 25 minutes, flipping after the first 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Serve with your favorite dipping sauce. </step>
