  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large, ovenproof skillet or frying pan, mix together the carrots, squash, and broccoli, and coat with the oil. Spread the veggies into 1 even layer. </step>
    <step num="2">Place the chicken on top of the veggies. </step>
    <step num="3">Season the bird on all sides and in the cavity with salt, pepper, and fresh thyme leaves. While seasoning the bird, make sure that enough seasoning has fallen onto the veggies below to give them good flavor. </step>
    <step num="4">To truss the chicken, fold the wingtips underneath the breasts so that they fit snugly. Using a piece of butcher’s twine, tie the legs together so the bird holds a nice shape. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 1 hour, or until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast reads 160°F (70°C). </step>
    <step num="6">NOTE: Once resting out of the oven, the temperature will continue to rise to a safe 165°F (75°C). </step>
    <step num="7">Let the chicken rest for at least 15 minutes once out of the oven, so that all of the juices in the meat can settle and the internal temperature has time to finish rising. </step>
    <step num="8">Carve the bird as desired. </step>
    <step num="9">Serve on a plate with the veggies, and fresh thyme sprigs for garnish. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
