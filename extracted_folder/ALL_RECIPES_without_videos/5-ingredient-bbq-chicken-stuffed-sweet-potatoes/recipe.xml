  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">Using a sharp knife, carve out one of the breasts from the rotisserie chicken. If the chicken is particularly small, use both breasts. Chop the chicken breast into very small pieces and set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Use a fork to poke holes all over the sweet potato. Transfer the sweet potato to the prepared baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="3">Bake for 40-50 minutes, until the sweet potato is tender when pierced with a paring knife or skewer. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the cabbage to a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the barbecue sauce and sauté until the cabbage starts to soften, about 3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the chopped chicken and stir just to incorporate. Remove the pan from the heat. </step>
    <step num="6">Once the sweet potato is cool enough to handle, slice it in half lengthwise and scoop out the flesh with a spoon until a ¼-inch (6 mm) layer remains. </step>
    <step num="7">Fill the sweet potato skins with the chicken and cabbage filling, drizzle with barbecue sauce, and top with the sliced green onions. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
