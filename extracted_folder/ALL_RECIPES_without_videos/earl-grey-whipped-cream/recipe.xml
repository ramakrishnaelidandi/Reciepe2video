  <steps>
    <step num="0">Heat the double cream to a simmer. Turn off heat and add your choice of tea. Steep until desired taste is achieved (about 30 minutes for us) and remove tea. Let cool completely. </step>
    <step num="1">Add sugar and whip cream until stiff peaks appear. </step>
    <step num="2">Place whipped cream into a piping bag and set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">To make the tea cup and saucer, shape the foil into a cup. </step>
    <step num="4">Cut a long rectangle of puff pastry and wrap around the bottom side of the foil cup. Cut, fold, and press pastry until it covers the entire bottom of the foil, forming a full cup. </step>
    <step num="5">Cut a second small strip of puff pastry to create the cup’s handle. Make two slits in the side of the pastry cup and shove the ends of the pastry handle into the slits. </step>
    <step num="6">To make the saucer, simply cut out a circle of pastry. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake the cup and saucer at 400°F (200°C) until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="8">Cut saucer in half and place cup on top. Pipe whipped cream into tea cup. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
