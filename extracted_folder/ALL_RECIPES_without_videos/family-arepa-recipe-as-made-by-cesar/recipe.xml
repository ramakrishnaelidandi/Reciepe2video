  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C) </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine the warm water and salt. Stir until the salt is dissolved. </step>
    <step num="2">Slowly add the arepa flour while stirring. Adjust the consistency as needed by adding more water or flour. The dough is ready when it pulls away from the sides of the bowl and doesn’t stick to your fingers. </step>
    <step num="3">Grab a fist-sized ball of the dough and pass it from one hand to the other to pat into an even, flattened round. Pay attention to the edges so as to not leave cracks. </step>
    <step num="4">Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the arepas, flipping once, until golden brown in color, 5-7 minutes on each side </step>
    <step num="5">Transfer the arepas to the oven and cook for 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Make the chicken avocado salad: In a medium bowl, combine the shredded rotisserie chicken, avocados, lime juice, onion, bell pepper, garlic, mayonnaise, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine. </step>
    <step num="7">Cut the arepas in half and stuff with the chicken avocado salad or your favorite fillings. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
