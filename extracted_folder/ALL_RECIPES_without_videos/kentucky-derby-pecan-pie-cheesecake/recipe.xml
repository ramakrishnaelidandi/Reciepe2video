  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 325°F (170°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. Stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">Pour the mixture into a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan and press it evenly into the bottom and halfway up the sides. Transfer to the refrigerator to chill. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large bowl add the cream cheese, sugar, and milk. With a hand mixer, beat until fluffy and fully incorporated. </step>
    <step num="4">Add in the sour cream, flour, 2 teaspoons of the bourbon, and the two eggs and gently continue to mix until the cream cheese filling is smooth. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour the mixture into the springform pan with the graham cracker crust and bake for 1 hour, or until the cheesecake no longer jiggles. </step>
    <step num="6">While the cheesecake is cooking, prepare the stove-top pecan pie filling. </step>
    <step num="7">In a bowl combine the brown sugar, cornstarch, and salt, stir together and pour into a medium saucepan on low heat. </step>
    <step num="8">Pour in the egg yolks, maple syrup, and warm cream and whisk until smooth. </step>
    <step num="9">Cook on low heat until the mixture thickens like a pudding, 5-10 minutes. Remove from the heat. </step>
    <step num="10">Stir in the cold butter and the final teaspoon of bourbon and whisk until fully emulsified. The pudding-like mixture should be around room temperature. </step>
    <step num="11">Fold in the roasted, chopped pecans and then pour the mixture over the cooked cheesecake and spread it out as an even layer. </step>
    <step num="12">If you like, sprinkle with extra chopped pecans or garnish with whole pecans. </step>
    <step num="13">Let the cheesecake chill in the refrigerator until completely set. </step>
    <step num="14">Slice and serve cold or at room temperature. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
