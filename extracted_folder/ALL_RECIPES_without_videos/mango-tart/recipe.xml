  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, beat the egg. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the butter and sugar, and mix. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the flour and mix until combined. The dough will be crumbly in your hand. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the crust mixture into a greased 8-inch (20 cm) tart pan one handful at a time, pressing it down to create an even, thin layer over the entire pan, about ¼ inch (6 mm). </step>
    <step num="5">NOTE: Freeze and save remaining pie crust crumble for later. </step>
    <step num="6">Prick the crust with a fork to prevent it from puffing up in the oven. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake the crust for 30-40 minutes, or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="8">On a cutting board, cut a half inch (1 cm) off the bottom and top off the mango to give it a flat base. Standing it upright, make exterior slices from the top to bottom to take the skin off. </step>
    <step num="9">Remove the meat from the sides and thinly slice. </step>
    <step num="10">In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, Greek yogurt, orange zest, sugar, orange juice, and vanilla extract. Mix thoroughly. </step>
    <step num="11">Transfer the yogurt mixture to the cooled tart crust. </step>
    <step num="12">Starting from the outer edge, place mango slices in a circular pattern, making full rotations all the way to the center. </step>
    <step num="13">Chill the fruit tart for at least an hour. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
