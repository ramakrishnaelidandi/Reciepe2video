  <steps>
    <step num="0">Pour the granola into a food processor. Pulse until the granola is broken into small pieces. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="1">In a small saucepan, mix together the butter, honey, and brown sugar over medium-low heat. Stir until the butter is melted, the sugar is dissolved, and the mixture begins to bubble, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Remove the pan from the heat and add ½ cup (60g) of the crushed granola. If mixture is still too wet to shape, add more granola. </step>
    <step num="3">Wrap 4 spoons tightly in aluminum foil. Lightly grease with nonstick cooking spray and set on a parchment-lined baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="4">When the granola mixture is cool enough to handle, mold onto the front of each foil-covered spoon. </step>
    <step num="5">Freeze for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="7">Place another piece of aluminum foil under the spoons. Fold it up around the edges of each spoon so the granola mold is nestled inside. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Cool the spoons for 10 minutes, then remove the granola spoons from the molds. </step>
    <step num="10">Chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="11">Serve with yogurt, if desired. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
