  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C). </step>
    <step num="1">If your bananas aren’t already very ripe, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until they are nearly black. Be careful to not overcook or the bananas will leak. </step>
    <step num="2">Let the bananas cool to room temperature. Increase the oven temperature to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="3">Peel the bananas, then place them in a large bowl. Mash bananas using a hand mixer or fork. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the egg, vegetable oil, sugar, milk, and vanilla. Beat until combined. </step>
    <step num="5">Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into the banana mixture. Beat until just combined, being careful to not overmix. </step>
    <step num="6">Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the chocolate sprinkles into the batter. </step>
    <step num="7">Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray. Divide the batter among the cups. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the tops are lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. </step>
    <step num="9">Place the chocolate chips in a heatproof liquid measuring cup. Pour over the hot heavy cream. Let sit for 1 minute, then stir until the chocolate is melted and smooth. </step>
    <step num="10">While the muffins are still warm, use the back of a wooden spoon to push down a hole into the center of each muffin. Allow to cool to room temperature. </step>
    <step num="11">Fill the muffins with the chocolate ganache. </step>
    <step num="12">Chill the muffins in the fridge for at least 1 hour, until the center has set. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
