  <steps>
    <step num="0">Place graham crackers in a gallon-sized re-sealable plastic bag. Crush crackers with rolling pin until fine in texture. </step>
    <step num="1">In a bowl, combine crushed graham cracker with melted butter and mix well. </step>
    <step num="2">Line a 9×9 inch (23x23 cm) pan with parchment paper. Fill pan with graham cracker crumbs and pat down to create one even, compressed crust. Place in freezer. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large bowl, combine ingredients for peppermint cream with hand mixer until a thick, uniform cream is formed. </step>
    <step num="4">Remove pan from freezer and layer the peppermint cream on crust in one even layer. Freeze for at least 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="5">Remove pan from freezer and cut the sheet sheet of peppermint cream and graham cracker into 36 squares (i.e. 6 lengthwise cuts and 6 crosswise cuts). Place squares on a metal cooling rack. </step>
    <step num="6">In a small bowl, combine chocolate and coconut oil (the exact amount of coconut oil needed may vary based on the chocolate used). Microwave in 20-second intervals, stirring between each, until chocolate is fully melted. </step>
    <step num="7">Top squares with melted chocolate. </step>
    <step num="8">Chill squares in fridge or freezer until ready to eat. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
