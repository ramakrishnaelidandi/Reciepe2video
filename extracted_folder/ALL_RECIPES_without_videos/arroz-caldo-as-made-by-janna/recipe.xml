    <step num="1">Cube the chicken breasts. </step>
    <step num="2">Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the garlic and fry until golden brown, 2-3 minutes. Remove from the pan, draining off any excess oil, and set aside. </step>
