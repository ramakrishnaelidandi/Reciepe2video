  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Arrange tater tots on a 11x17 inch (28x43 cm) nonstick baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="2">Place strips of bacon on a separate baking sheet, and bake along with the tater tots. </step>
    <step num="3">Bake the tater tots according to package directions, about 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway. </step>
    <step num="4">While the bacon and tater tots cook, prepare your buffalo mixture and cheese sauce. </step>
    <step num="5">In a mixing bowl, season chicken lightly with a pinch of salt and pepper. Add the green onions and buffalo sauce. Mix well and keep warm. </step>
    <step num="6">In a pot, combine cheddar cheese and cornstarch. Stir until cheese is well coated with the cornstarch. Set the saucepan set over medium heat, adding in evaporated milk and buffalo sauce. </step>
    <step num="7">Bring sauce to simmer, whisking constantly until cheese has melted and sauce has thickened, about 5-8 minutes. Set aside and keep warm over very low heat. Stirring occasionally to prevent burning. </step>
    <step num="8">Once crispy, remove bacon from oven. Place strips on top of a paper towel to strain excess fat. Chop strips into a rough dice. Set aside </step>
    <step num="9">Remove tater tots from the oven once lightly browned on the bottom. Lightly season with a pinch of salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="10">To assemble totchos, layer tater tots followed by the cheese sauce and buffalo chicken onto your serving platter. </step>
    <step num="11">Garnish with blue cheese dressing, remaining buffalo sauce, bacon and remaining green onions. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
