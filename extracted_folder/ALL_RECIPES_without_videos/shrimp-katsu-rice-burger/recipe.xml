  <steps>
    <step num="0">Roughly chop half of shrimp and finely chop the rest until it becomes a paste. </step>
    <step num="1">Place the shrimp and tofu in a medium bowl and break up with a spatula. Add the mayonnaise, salt, and pepper. Mix well. </step>
    <step num="2">Using your hands, form the shrimp mixture into 2 patties. </step>
    <step num="3">Place the flour, eggs, and panko in 3 separate medium bowls. Dredge the shrimp patties in the flour, then egg, then panko bread crumbs. </step>
    <step num="4">Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350°F (180°C). Fry the shrimp patties until golden brown, then drain on paper towels. </step>
    <step num="5">Line a ramekin with plastic wrap, and mold a quarter of the rice into a patty. Repeat with the remaining rice to make 4 "buns". </step>
    <step num="6">In a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, heat a splash of sesame oil, then add the rice buns. Cook, flipping once, until the outside is crispy. </step>
    <step num="7">Make the tartar sauce: In a small bowl, combine the boiled egg, mayonnaise, pickles, and onions. </step>
    <step num="8">Assemble the burgers: start with the rice “bun,” then add the green leaf lettuce, shrimp katsu burger, a dollop of tartar sauce, and top with another rice “bun.” </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
