  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C). Grease a 6-indent donut pan with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="1">Combine the flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, combine the applesauce, almond milk, maple syrup, vanilla, and apple cider vinegar. Whisk until smooth. </step>
    <step num="3">Using a spatula, fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients in two additions until thoroughly combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour the batter into the donut pan and smooth the tops with a spatula. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 15–20 minutes, or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in a donut comes out clean. </step>
    <step num="6">Let cool for 5–10 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely. </step>
    <step num="7">Combine the powdered sugar and cocoa powder in a wide, medium bowl. Add the almond milk, about 2 tablespoons at a time, until the glaze is smooth, but thick enough to set on top of the donuts. </step>
    <step num="8">Dip the top of each donut in the glaze and return to baking rack to let any excess glaze drip off. </step>
    <step num="9">If using sprinkles, add them immediately after glazing the donuts. Work quickly, as the glaze will harden very fast. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
