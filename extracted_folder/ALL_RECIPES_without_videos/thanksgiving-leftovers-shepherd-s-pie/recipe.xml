  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Melt butter in a large pot. Then add onions and carrots and cook until tender (about 5 minutes on medium heat). </step>
    <step num="2">Add in mushrooms and peas. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Then, add in the turkey, salt, pepper, parsley, and thyme and stir until well-blended. Pour in the gravy and heavy cream, stir, and cook on low heat for 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer to a greased baking dish or ramekins. Top with leftover mashed potatoes (use a piping bag to achieve the look of our pie). </step>
    <step num="5">Mist with nonstick cooking spray. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes until the potatoes are lightly browned and the filling is bubbly around the edges. (This may get messy, so clean up the edges before serving.) </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
