  <steps>
    <step num="0">In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the milk and yeast and let sit for 5 minutes, or until it starts to bubble. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the flour, sugar, and salt to the bowl with the yeast. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the dough hook attachment, and mix for 30 seconds, or until the dough is shaggy. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated, about 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing until fully incorporated. If the dough is too sticky, add 1 tablespoon of flour at a time. </step>
    <step num="5">Once the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl, transfer it to a lightly floured surface and knead for 3 to 4 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Place the dough in a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in size. </step>
    <step num="7">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C) </step>
    <step num="8">On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a 12x6-inch (30x15 cm) rectangle. </step>
    <step num="9">In a small bowl, whisk the egg and heavy cream until well combined. Brush the mixture over the rolled out dough. </step>
    <step num="10">Spread the blueberries in an even layer over the bread. </step>
    <step num="11">Starting at the bottom, carefully roll the dough up into a log. Place the dough in a parchment paper-lined loaf pan. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise for 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size. </step>
    <step num="12">Brush the dough with the remaining egg wash, and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. </step>
    <step num="13">Bake for 45 minutes, or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="14">Rest for 15 to 20 minutes, then remove from pan. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
