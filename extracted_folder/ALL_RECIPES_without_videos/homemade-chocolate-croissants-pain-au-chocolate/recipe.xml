  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, mix the flour, water, milk, sugar, salt, yeast, and butter. </step>
    <step num="1">Once the dough starts to clump, turn it out onto a clean counter. </step>
    <step num="2">Lightly knead the dough and form it into a ball, making sure not to over-knead it. </step>
    <step num="3">Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour. </step>
    <step num="4">Slice the cold butter in thirds and place it onto a sheet of parchment paper.. </step>
    <step num="5">Place another piece of parchment on top of the butter, and beat it with a rolling pin. </step>
    <step num="6">Keeping the parchment paper on the butter, use a rolling pin to roll the butter into a 7-inch (18 cm) square, ½-inch (1 cm) thick. If necessary, use a knife to trim the edges and place the trimmings back on top of the butter and continue to roll into a square. </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer the butter layer to the refrigerator. </step>
    <step num="8">To roll out the dough, lightly flour the counter. Place the dough on the counter, and push the rolling pin once vertically into the dough and once horizontally to form four quadrants. </step>
    <step num="9">Roll out each corner and form a 10-inch (25 cm) square. </step>
    <step num="10">Place the butter layer on top of the dough and fold the sides of the dough over the butter, enclosing it completely. </step>
    <step num="11">Roll the dough with a rolling pin to seal the seams, making sure to lengthen the dough, rather than widening it. </step>
    <step num="12">Transfer the dough to a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="13">Roll out the dough on a floured surface until it’s 8x24 inches (20x61 cm). </step>
    <step num="14">Fold the top half down to the middle, and brush off any excess flour. </step>
    <step num="15">Fold the bottom half over the top and turn the dough clockwise to the left. This completes the first turn. </step>
    <step num="16">Cover and refrigerate for one hour. </step>
    <step num="17">Roll out the dough again two more times, completing three turns in total and refrigerating for 1 hour in between each turn. If at anytime the dough or butter begins to soften, stop and transfer back to the fridge. </step>
    <step num="18">After the final turn, cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. </step>
    <step num="19">To form the croissants, cut the dough in half. Place one half in the refrigerator. </step>
    <step num="20">Flour the surface and roll out the dough into a long narrow strip, about 8x40 inches (20x101 cm). </step>
    <step num="21">With a knife, trim the edges of the dough. </step>
    <step num="22">Cut the dough into 4 rectangles. </step>
    <step num="23">Place the chocolate on the edge of the dough and roll tightly enclosing it in the dough. </step>
    <step num="24">Place the croissants on a baking sheet, seam side down. </step>
    <step num="25">Repeat with the other half of the dough. </step>
    <step num="26">Brush the croissants with the beaten egg. Save the rest of the egg wash in the fridge for later. </step>
    <step num="27">Place the croissants in a warm place to rise for 1-2 hours. </step>
    <step num="28">Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="29">Once the croissants have proofed, brush them with one more layer of egg wash. </step>
    <step num="30">Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through. Serve warm. </step>
    <step num="31">Enjoy! </step>
