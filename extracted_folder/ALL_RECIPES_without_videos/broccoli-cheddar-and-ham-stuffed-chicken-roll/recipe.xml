    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350째F (180째C). </step>
    <step num="1">Finely chop the broccoli florets, and then transfer to a large bowl. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the cheddar, cream cheese, ham, onion powder, and mix evenly until combined. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">In a bowl, mix together the salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, and paprika, then stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="4">Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board and slice across horizontally, making sure not to cut all the way through. </step>
    <step num="5">Season both sides of the chicken liberally with the spice mix. </step>
    <step num="6">Place each chicken breast on a double layer of plastic wrap, then cover with more plastic wrap. </step>
    <step num="7">Use a meat pounder to thinly pound the chicken breast and form into a rectangular shape. </step>
    <step num="8">Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts. </step>
    <step num="9">Lay down two of the flattened chicken breasts into a greased loaf pan lined with parchment paper, slightly overlapping them. </step>
