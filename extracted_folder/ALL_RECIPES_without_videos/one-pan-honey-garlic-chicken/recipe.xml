  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C) </step>
    <step num="1">Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="2">Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add chicken, skin-side down, and sear both sides until golden brown. (The skin side will take much longer, in order to properly render the fat and crisp up the skin.) </step>
    <step num="3">Remove chicken thighs and set aside. Pour out any excess fat, but leave some in for the sauce. </step>
    <step num="4">Add garlic, stir until fragrant, then add brown sugar, honey, thyme, and oregano, and stir. Reduce heat to low. </step>
    <step num="5">Return chicken to the skillet. Coat the chicken in the sauce. </step>
    <step num="6">Add green beans to skillet. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
