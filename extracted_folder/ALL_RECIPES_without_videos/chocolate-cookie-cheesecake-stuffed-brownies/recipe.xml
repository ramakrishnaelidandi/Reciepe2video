  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Grease a rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="1">Combine the melted butter and 3 cups (600 g) of sugar in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Let sit for a minute to cool before adding the eggs, to avoid cooking them, then add 6 eggs and 2 tablespoons of vanilla and whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">Sift in the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Whisk until just combined. </step>
    <step num="3">Use a spatula to fold in the chocolate chips. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour the batter onto the prepared baking sheet, spreading to the edges with a spatula. Bake for 25 minutes, or until brownies appear be nearly fully cooked. </step>
    <step num="5">While the brownies are beginning to bake, beat together the cream cheese and the remaining sugar in a medium bowl with an electric hand mixer until there are no lumps. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the remaining egg and remaining teaspoon of vanilla, beating until evenly combined. </step>
    <step num="7">After 25 minutes, remove the brownies from the oven and use the bottom of a ¼-cup (60 ml) measuring cup to make 24 evenly spaced indentations in the brownies. </step>
    <step num="8">Carefully fill the indentations with cheesecake filling. Top each with a chocolate sandwich cookie. </step>
    <step num="9">Return to the oven for 15 more minutes, until the cheesecake filling is set. </step>
    <step num="10">Let cool, then cut into squares and serve. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
