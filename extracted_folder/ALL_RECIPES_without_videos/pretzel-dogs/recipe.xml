  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 450˚F (230˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Dust the cutting board with flour, and cut the pizza dough into 4 equal pieces. </step>
    <step num="2">Roll each piece of dough out until it’s a 12-inch (30 ½ cm) rope. It’s okay if the dough naturally shrinks. </step>
    <step num="3">Take the rolled out dough and wrap it around a hot dog in a spiraling motion, leaving room on the ends. </step>
    <step num="4">In a pot, combine the baking soda with the water and bring it to a boil. </step>
    <step num="5">Cook each pretzel dog in the solution for 30 seconds each. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a baking tray. </step>
    <step num="6">Brush each pretzel dog with the egg wash. </step>
    <step num="7">Top the pretzels with your toppings of choice. </step>
    <step num="8">For sea salt, sprinkle the salt on top. For jalapeño cheddar, top the pretzel with cheddar cheese, then follow with jalapeños. For garlic butter, combine the butter, garlic, and parsley, and brush on top. For pizza, top with mozzarella and follow with pepperoni. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until it reaches a deep golden brown. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
