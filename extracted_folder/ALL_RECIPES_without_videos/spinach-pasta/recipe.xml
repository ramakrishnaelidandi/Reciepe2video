  <steps>
    <step num="0">Bring a large pot of water to a boil. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the spinach and cook for 5 minutes, or until wilted. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the spinach to a food processor and process until finely chopped. </step>
    <step num="3">While processing the spinach, spoon the flour in a little bit at a time until a crumbly dough forms. </step>
    <step num="4">While continuing to process, add ¼ teaspoon of salt. Then, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until dough comes together (the amount of water necessary will vary depending on how wet the spinach is). </step>
    <step num="5">Remove the dough from the food processor and knead on a floured surface to form into a ball. </step>
    <step num="6">With a rolling pin, roll dough out into an oval, about 18 inches (46 cm) long by 12 inches (30 cm) wide, and ¼-inch (6 mm) thick. </step>
    <step num="7">With a knife or pizza cutter, cut the dough into even strips about ½ inch (1 cm) wide. </step>
    <step num="8">Roll the strips into thick noodles. </step>
    <step num="9">Once the water is boiling, add 1 tablespoon of salt and drop in the pasta. </step>
    <step num="10">Cook the pasta for 3-5 minutes, or until the noodles float to the top. Drain. </step>
    <step num="11">Toss with roasted vegetables and pesto and top with basil. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
