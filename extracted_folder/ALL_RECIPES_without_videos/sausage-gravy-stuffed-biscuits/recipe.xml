  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a cast-iron skillet, break up the ground sausage into small chunks and brown over medium-high heat until sausage is cooked through and no longer pink. </step>
    <step num="2">Reduce heat to medium-low. Sprinkle the flour over the sausage and stir until the flour has absorbed all of the sausage fat and is lightly coating the sausage pieces. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the milk in several increments while whisking. </step>
    <step num="4">Add thyme, sage, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and salt. </step>
    <step num="5">Cook the gravy for 5-10 minutes, frequently stirring until the gravy thickens. Let cool. </step>
    <step num="6">Fill a well-greased ice cube tray with the gravy. (If you do not have an ice cube tray, pour the gravy onto a greased parchment-lined ½ cookie sheet.) </step>
    <step num="7">Freeze for 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">With your thumb, make a divot in the center of each biscuit. </step>
    <step num="9">Place a cube of gravy into each divot. </step>
    <step num="10">Fold the sides of the biscuit dough around the gravy cube pinching the dough together at the top. </step>
    <step num="11">Turn the dough balls upside down. With the palm of your hand, roll the biscuit ball around in a clockwise motion on your table surface to smooth out the dough balls. </step>
    <step num="12">Place the biscuits on a parchment lined ½ cookie sheet making sure the dough seams are on the bottom. Brush with egg wash. </step>
    <step num="13">Bake for 20-30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
