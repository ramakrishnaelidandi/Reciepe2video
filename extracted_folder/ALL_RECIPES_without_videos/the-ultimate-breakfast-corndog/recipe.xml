  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large pan over medium heat, heat the olive oil for 1 minute. Add the breakfast sausages to the pan and cook for 12 minutes, turning constantly, until crispy and browned all over. </step>
    <step num="1">Drain the sausages on paper towels and let cool. Insert a small ice pop stick in each sausage. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Make the pancake batter: In a large bowl, sift together the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and sugar. Use your hands to make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients. Pour the milk, eggs, and melted butter into the well, then stir the center working your way out until the mixture is thick and well-combined. Fold in the bacon. </step>
    <step num="3">Heat the canola oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="4">Pour the pancake batter into a tall glass, then dip a sausage stick into the mixture. </step>
    <step num="5">Use tongs to gently place the battered sausage into the hot oil and cook until golden brown, 1-2 minutes. Drain on paper towels or a cooling rack. Repeat with the remaining sausages. </step>
    <step num="6">Dust with powdered sugar and serve with maple syrup. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
