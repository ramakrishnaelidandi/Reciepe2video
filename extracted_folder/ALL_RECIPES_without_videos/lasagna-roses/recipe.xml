  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onions and garlic. Cook until softened. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the ground beef, breaking it apart with a spoon, and stir until browned. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the sausage, breaking it apart with a spoon, and stir until browned. </step>
    <step num="4">Mix in 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan, salt, pepper, 3 tablespoons basil, and 2 tablespoons parsley, and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="5">Add 2 cups (520 g) of the tomato sauce and the tomato paste. Continue stirring until the meat sauce is bubbling. Reduce heat to low, and cover the pot, simmering for 45 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Mix together the ricotta, 2 tablespoons parsley, and 2 tablespoons basil. </step>
    <step num="7">Place one of the lasagna noodles on a cutting board and cut in half crosswise. Set one half of the noodle aside for later. </step>
    <step num="8">Evenly spread about 2 tablespoons of the ricotta mixture over the noodle half. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon mozzarella over the noodle. </step>
    <step num="9">Starting from the cut end of the noodle roll upward being careful not to squeeze the mixture out of the noodle. Repeat with the remaining noodles. </step>
    <step num="10">Place the spiral lasagna noodle in a greased muffin tin. </step>
    <step num="11">Sprinkle about 3 tablespoons mozzarella around the noodle spiral. </step>
    <step num="12">Pour 3 tablespoons of the meat sauce over the mozzarella around the noodle spiral. </step>
    <step num="13">Place the other half of the lasagna noodle on a cutting board, and cut it lengthwise. </step>
    <step num="14">Starting from the end of the noodle spiral, tuck the noodle strip into the spiral so the end of noodle spiral is on the outside. Wrap the noodle strip around the spiral while pushing it into the meat sauce. Repeat with the other noodle strip. </step>
    <step num="15">Pour about 2 tablespoons of the sauce in between the noodle “petals”. Sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon of both mozzarella and Parmesan. </step>
    <step num="16">Bake for about 30 minutes, until the top of the noodles are golden and crispy. </step>
    <step num="17">Let cool for about 5 minutes before removing from muffin tin. </step>
    <step num="18">Serve over tomato sauce. </step>
    <step num="19">Enjoy! </step>
