    <step num="0">Heat the canola oil (for the veggies) in a pan over high heat. Cook the peppers, onion, salt, and pepper until soft and slightly caramelized. </step>
    <step num="1">Transfer the cooked veggies to a bowl. In the same bowl, mix in the cream cheese, cheddar, and pepper jack, stirring until evenly incorporated. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">In a separate bowl, combine the chicken with the salt, chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder, evenly distributing the spices over the chicken. </step>
    <step num="3">On a cutting board, slice a pocket in the chicken horizontally. </step>
    <step num="4">Fill the pocket with a heaping spoonful of the veggie mixture. Press the edges of the chicken together to seal in the filling. Repeat with the remaining chicken. </step>
