  <steps>
    <step num="0">Heat the coconut oil in a large nonstick skillet. Toss in the diced onion and salt and sauté for about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Sprinkle in the ground dried oregano and cumin. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the minced chipotle and garlic and sauté until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. </step>
    <step num="3">Pour in the milk and stir the mixture to combine. You can use skim or low-fat milk instead of whole milk, but make sure to reduce it on a lower heat to avoid curdling the milk. </step>
    <step num="4">Once the mixture has bubbled and reduced slightly, mix in the shredded chicken until evenly coated. </step>
    <step num="5">Spoon the mixture evenly onto butter lettuce leaves. Top with pico de gallo or salsa and serve. </step>
