    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350℉ (175˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and grease with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and cocoa powder. Whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar with an electric hand mixer until fluffy. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating to incorporate each addition before adding the next. Add the vanilla and beat to combine. </step>
    <step num="3">Add ½ of the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat on low speed to incorporate. Add ½ of the coconut milk and beat again. Add the remaining flour, then the remaining coconut milk, and beat until fully incorporated. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour the cake batter onto the prepared baking sheet and spread in an even layer. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 20–25 minutes, or until the center is set and edges begin to pull away from the pan. Let cool completely. </step>
