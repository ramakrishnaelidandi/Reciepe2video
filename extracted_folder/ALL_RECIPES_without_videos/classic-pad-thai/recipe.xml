    <step num="0">Soak rice noodles in room temperature water 30 minutes prior to cooking. </step>
    <step num="1">In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, whisk together palm sugar, tamarind paste, and fish sauce. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and reduce for 5 minutes until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon. Remove sauce from heat and set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Heat a cast-iron pan or wok over high heat. </step>
    <step num="3">Add oil and chicken and cook for about two minutes until nearly cooked through and nicely seared on all sides. </step>
    <step num="4">Add minced garlic, shallots, and turnips to the chicken and stir to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="5">Move the chicken to the side of the pan and add the egg. Break the egg up with a spatula or wooden spoon and stir to scramble. </step>
    <step num="6">Add soaked rice noodles and stir to evenly incorporate all ingredients, stirring for 1 to 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Add 2 or 3 tablespoons of the reduced sauce and stir. </step>
    <step num="8">Add tofu, Chinese chives or green onions, and bean sprouts. Stir to incorporate and remove from heat. </step>
