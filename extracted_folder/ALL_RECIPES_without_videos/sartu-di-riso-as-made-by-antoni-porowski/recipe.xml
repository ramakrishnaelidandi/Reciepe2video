  <steps>
    <step num="0">Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion, carrot, and celery, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, 3-5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Add a bit more oil, if needed, then add the garlic, a pinch of salt, 2 bay leaves, and the tomato paste. Stir until the tomato paste begins to caramelize on the bottom of the pan, 1-2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the canned tomatoes and break them apart with tongs or the back of a wooden spoon. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the Parmesan rind and basil, burying them into the sauce. </step>
    <step num="4">Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes until the sauce has thickened and the flavors have developed. Remove and discard the Parmesan rind, bay leaves, and basil. Set the sauce aside to cool. </step>
    <step num="5">Prepare the rice. In a large pot over medium-high heat, add the rice and stock and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the 2 remaining bay leaves and a pinch of salt. </step>
    <step num="7">Bring to a boil, then immediately cover and reduce down to a simmer. </step>
    <step num="8">Simmer for 15 minutes without removing the lid. </step>
    <step num="9">After 15 minutes remove from the rice from the heat, stir, and transfer to a large bowl to cool for 5-10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="10">Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C) </step>
    <step num="11">Once the rice has cooled, taste to check if it needs more salt, then add the eggs and grated Parmesan cheese. Mix thoroughly with your hands. </step>
    <step num="12">Generously coat the inside of a bundt pan with butter. </step>
    <step num="13">Add the breadcrumbs and tilt the pan around to coat. Once well-coated, tap out excess crumbs into a bowl and reserve. </step>
    <step num="14">Using your hands, line the bundt pan with an even layer of the rice, bringing it up to about ½ an inch (1 cm) from the top of the pan. </step>
    <step num="15">Tear apart the mozzarella and layer it over the rice. </step>
    <step num="16">Cover with a layer of tomato sauce. </step>
    <step num="17">Top with a layer of rice mixture and smooth with the back of a spoon to seal in the sauce completely. </step>
    <step num="18">Top with reserved bread crumbs and brush with oil or spray with cooking spray to ensure a nice crust forms. </step>
    <step num="19">Bake for 30-35 minutes, until golden brown and edges have crisped up.. </step>
    <step num="20">Remove from the oven and cool for about 10 minutes before flipping out of the pan. </step>
    <step num="21">Fill the cavity with any remaining tomato sauce and garnish with basil, Parmesan, and a drizzle of olive oil. </step>
    <step num="22">Slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="23">Enjoy! </step>
