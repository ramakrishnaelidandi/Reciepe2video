  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the pasta dough. Combine the flour and salt and make a small mountain of flour on a clean, flat surface. Make a well in the middle. </step>
    <step num="1">Add 2 eggs to the well, and using a fork, carefully incorporate the eggs into the flour. Add the egg yolks and carefully mix into the flour. </step>
    <step num="2">Once the eggs are incorporated, knead the dough by pulling, stretching, and folding for 3-5 minutes, or until it’s smooth and elastic. </step>
    <step num="3">Shape the dough into a ball, and wrap it in plastic wrap. Rest in a fridge for 30 minutes to overnight. </step>
    <step num="4">Make the ricotta-herb mixture. In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, parsley, basil, Parmesan cheese, egg, salt, and pepper. Mix well and set aside. </step>
    <step num="5">In a large pot of boiling water, cook the rigatoni, then the jumbo shell pasta for 5 minutes less than the suggested cooking time. Transfer the cooked pasta to two separate medium bowls. </step>
    <step num="6">Mix the marinara sauce with cooked rigatoni. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="7">Stuff the jumbo shells with the ricotta-herb mixture. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="8">Grease 10-inch (25 cm) diameter dutch oven with olive oil. </step>
    <step num="9">Using a rolling pin, roll out the pasta dough on a lightly floured surface until it is about ⅛ inches (3 mm) thick and 2 times larger than the Dutch oven you are using. </step>
    <step num="10">Fold the rolled out dough into a triangle and transfer it to the pot, pressing down around the edges, letting the excess dough hang over the sides of the pot. </step>
    <step num="11">Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C) </step>
    <step num="12">Layer the pasta-lined pot with the rigatoni, mozzarella, meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, provolone, ricotta-stuffed shells, caramelized onions, and sausages. </step>
    <step num="13">Fold the pasta dough over the sausages and cover with the lid. Bake for 45 minutes, then remove the lid and bake for 30 minutes more. Cool for at least 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="14">Invert the timpano onto a cutting board and cool for 10 more minutes before cutting. </step>
    <step num="15">Serve with marinara sauce. </step>
    <step num="16">Enjoy! </step>
