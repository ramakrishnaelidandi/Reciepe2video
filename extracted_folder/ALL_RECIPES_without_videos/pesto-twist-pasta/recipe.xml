  <steps>
    <step num="0">Cook fusilli ( or rotini) in boiling salted water until it’s al dente. Reserve 1 cup (235 ml) of the pasta water before draining. </step>
    <step num="1">Add basil, garlic, pine nuts, salt, and pepper to a food processor or blender and pulse to start to break up the ingredients. Add water and a splash of the olive oil to get things started. </step>
    <step num="2">Scrape down the sides of processor bowl to ensure everything is being incorporated evenly. </step>
    <step num="3">Put the top back on, turn on the food processor, and slowly drizzle the remaining olive oil through the hole on the top of the food processor until emulsified in the sauce. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour the pesto into a bowl, then stir in the parmesan. (The heat of the food processor will start to melt the cheese, so adding it afterwards retains a nice texture) </step>
    <step num="5">Drain the pasta and transfer to large bowl or pan. </step>
    <step num="6">Add pesto and a splash of pasta water, stirring to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="7">Add parmesan and another splash of pasta water. </step>
    <step num="8">Top off with more cheese and basil before serving. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
