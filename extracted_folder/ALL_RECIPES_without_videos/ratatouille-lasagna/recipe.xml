  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a skillet on medium-high heat. Once warmed, add the onion, bell peppers, 4 minced garlic cloves, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and caramelized. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the eggplant, yellow squash, zucchini, tomato paste, dried oregano, and 1 tablespoon of thyme, and more salt and pepper. Cook until the vegetables are soft and the tomato paste deepens in color and starts to stick to the bottom. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the diced tomatoes and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook on low for at least 30 minutes. Set aside to prepare the rest of the lasagna layers. </step>
    <step num="4">In a large bowl, mix together the ricotta, mozzarella, basil, parsley, salt, pepper and egg. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="5">To a bowl, add the sliced Japanese eggplant, yellow squash, zucchini, Roma tomatoes, garlic, 1 tablespoon thyme, salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons olive oil, and gently toss to combine. </step>
    <step num="6">In a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) glass baking pan, add a layer of the ratatouille to the bottom. Top with lasagna noodles, and spread a layer of the ricotta mixture, then shingle alternating slices of the marinated vegetables. Repeat with another layer of ratatouille, noodles, ricotta, and on the top shingle the vegetables. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 30 minutes, or until the cheese and sauce are bubbling slightly and the sliced vegetables on top have browned to your liking. </step>
    <step num="8">Slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
