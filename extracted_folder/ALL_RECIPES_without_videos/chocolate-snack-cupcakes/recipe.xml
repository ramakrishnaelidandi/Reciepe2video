  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl. Add the sugar and whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the warm water, buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla and whisk until combined. </step>
    <step num="3">Line 2 muffin tins with paper liners. </step>
    <step num="4">Scoop the batter into prepared muffin tins, filling each cup a little more than halfway. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for about 20 minutes, until the tops of the cupcakes spring back when gently pressed. Let cool completely. </step>
    <step num="6">Make the marshmallow filling: In a medium bowl, whip the heavy cream with an electric hand mixer until soft peaks form. Add the marshmallow cream and whip until stiff. </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer the filling to a piping bag fitted with a medium round tip or a zip-top bag with a corner snipped off. </step>
    <step num="8">Use the end of a whisk or another utensil to push down the center of each cupcake. </step>
    <step num="9">Pipe the filling into the cupcakes, leveling off the tops if needed. Freeze for 15 minutes while you make the ganache and icing. </step>
    <step num="10">Make the ganache: Add the chocolate chips and heavy cream to a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second increments, until melted. Mix together until smooth. </step>
    <step num="11">Make the icing: In a medium bowl, stir together the powdered sugar and milk until smooth. The icing should fall off the spatula in ribbons. If it is too thin, add a bit more powdered sugar. </step>
    <step num="12">Transfer the icing to a piping bag fitted with a small tip or a zip-top bag with a corner snipped off. </step>
    <step num="13">Dip the top of each cupcake in the ganache, then set aside to dry for 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="14">Pipe icing curls across the center of the cupcakes and let dry for 15 minutes at room temperature. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
