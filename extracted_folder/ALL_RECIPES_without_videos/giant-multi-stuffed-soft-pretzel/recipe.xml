  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, whisk together the water and sugar. Add the yeast and let rest for 5 minutes, until it starts to foam. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the flour, salt, and 1 tablespoon of oil, and mix thoroughly until the dough comes together. </step>
    <step num="2">Remove the dough, grease the bowl with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, then return the dough to the bowl and cover with a dish towel or plastic wrap. Let sit in a warm place for 1 hour, until the dough has doubled in size. </step>
    <step num="3">Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="4">Using your fingers or a rolling pin, stretch or roll the dough out into a long, thin strip, about 30 inches (76 cm) long and 4 inches (10 cm) wide. </step>
    <step num="5">Spread the softened cream cheese down the middle of the dough strip, leaving a 1-inch (2 cm) border on each end. </step>
    <step num="6">Sprinkle the Parmesan, chives, and black pepper over the first third of the cream cheese on the dough strip. </step>
    <step num="7">Spread the pizza sauce over the middle third of cream cheese. Place the mozzarella and pepperoni over the sauce. </step>
    <step num="8">Sprinkle the bacon and cheddar cheese over the cream cheese on the last third of the dough strip. </step>
    <step num="9">Fold and pinch the dough around the cheese fillings along the entire strip, ensuring the ends are closed. Roll slightly to seal and lengthen. </step>
    <step num="10">Carefully form a pretzel shape by taking the ends of the strip, making a “U” shape, twisting the ends around each other, and connecting the ends to the bottom of the “U” shape. </step>
    <step num="11">Transfer the pretzel to the prepared baking sheet and brush with egg wash. Sprinkle with coarse salt. </step>
    <step num="12">Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="13">Cool for 10 minutes, then brush with melted butter before serving. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
