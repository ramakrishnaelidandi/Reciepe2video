  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Cut pineapple in half lengthwise, cutting from root through the leaves. </step>
    <step num="2">Hollow out the pineapple by slicing around the perimeter, leaving a ½ inch (1 ¼ cm) border. </step>
    <step num="3">Slice the pineapple inside the cut border, and scoop out with a spoon. Repeat with the other half and set aside, as this will be the serving bowl for the salmon. </step>
    <step num="4">Add pineapple and water to a blender and blend until smooth. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour the pineapple purée into a saucepan over medium heat. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the sugar, rice wine vinegar, chile flakes, salt, and garlic to the pan and bring to a simmer. Stir frequently until sauce becomes lighter in color and slightly thickens. </step>
    <step num="7">In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch with the water to make a slurry. Add the slurry to the sauce and until sauce has thickened, 4-7 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. </step>
    <step num="8">Place the salmon on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and cover each fillet with the sauce. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 12-15 minutes, depending on your desired doneness. </step>
    <step num="10">Serve the salmon the pineapple bowls over rice with more pineapple sweet chile sauce on the side. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
