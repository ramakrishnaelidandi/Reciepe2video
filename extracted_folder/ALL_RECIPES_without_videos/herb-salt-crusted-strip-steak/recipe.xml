    <step num="1">Let the steak rest at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to cooking. This will help the steak cook more evenly. </step>
    <step num="2">Season the steak liberally on both sides with the herb salt. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large cast-iron skillet, heat a drizzle of oil over medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Sear the steak for 4-5 minutes on each side, depending on thickness and your desired doneness. Sear on the sides for 1 minute each to crisp up the fat cap, if desired. For medium-rare steak, the internal temperature should read 135˚F (57˚C). </step>
    <step num="4">Let the steak rest for 10 minutes, then slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="5">Enjoy! </step>
