  <steps>
    <step num="0">Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the garlic, ginger, and scallions. Sauté for about 3 minutes, until very fragrant but not browned. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the oregano, parsley, cayenne, turmeric, black pepper, and soy sauce. Cook for 2 minutes, until the herbs begin to wilt. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the broccoli and cook until bright green and beginning to release some moisture, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the chicken stock. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the broccoli starts to soften. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the Swiss chard and stir until wilted, about 30 seconds. Add the baby spinach, a few handfuls at a time. Cook until just wilted and stir to incorporate into the soup before adding more. Once the spinach is wilted and the broccoli stems can be easily pierced with a fork, remove the soup from the heat. It is important not to overcook the greens, as they will begin to lose their vibrant color and nutrients. </step>
    <step num="5">Cool the soup for 15 minutes, until it can be safely transferred to a high-speed blender, if using. With a standing blender or immersion blender, puree the soup briefly to combine, then add the avocado, lemon juice, and salt and blend until creamy, with no lumps remaining. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy the soup hot or cold, garnished with toasted pumpkin seeds and parsley, if desired. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
