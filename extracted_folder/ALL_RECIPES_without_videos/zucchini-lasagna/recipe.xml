  <steps>
    <step num="0">Cut the ends off of the zucchini, and cut in half, lengthwise. </step>
    <step num="1">Using a vegetable peeler, peel long strips of zucchini (these will be your “noodles”) and set on a baking sheet lined with paper towels. </step>
    <step num="2">Dab zucchini strips with a paper towel to absorb the excess moisture. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large pot, add olive oil, onions, and garlic. Cook until translucent, about 4-5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Add ground turkey, and cook for another 4-5 minutes, or until the turkey has browned slightly. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour in crushed tomatoes, basil, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, tomato paste, and a bay leaf. Cover and let simmer for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C). </step>
    <step num="7">In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, parsley, parmesan, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined. </step>
    <step num="8">Using a baking dish, layer turkey sauce, zucchini strips, ricotta mixture, and parmesan. Repeat until there are 3 layers total, ending with the turkey sauce and topping that with parmesan cheese. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 50 minutes (times and temperatures may vary depending on the oven). </step>
    <step num="10">Let rest for at least 20 minutes. </step>
