  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 375ºF (190ºC). </step>
    <step num="1">Cut hot dogs into thirds. </step>
    <step num="2">Cut crescent roll triangles in half lengthwise so you have roughly 1-inch (2 ½ cm) by 5-inch (13 cm) triangle slices. </step>
    <step num="3">Roll crescent dough around hot dog thirds, starting with the wider end of the dough closest to the hot dogs, making “pigs in blankets.” </step>
    <step num="4">Arrange pigs in blankets around a 10-inch (25 cm) skillet in two tight circles, leaving a hole in the center of the skillet. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake 15-20 minutes, until dough puffs up and becomes golden. </step>
    <step num="6">In another large skillet, sauté onions until translucent. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the ground beef to the onions, then season with salt and pepper. Continue stirring ground beef until mostly cooked. </step>
    <step num="8">Add the tomato sauce, ketchup, cumin, chili powder, and sugar to the ground beef and onions. Stir until everything is well mixed. Simmer 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">When chili and the pigs-in-blankets skillet are both ready, spoon chili to fill the hole in center of the skillet. Top with shredded cheddar cheese. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake another 5-10 minutes until cheese is well melted. </step>
    <step num="11">Top with diced green onion and serve. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
