  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large pot over medium heat, cook the bacon crispy and the fat has rendered. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the garlic, bread crumbs, chives, and parsley. Stir and cook until the bread crumbs are toasted, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pot. </step>
    <step num="3">In the same pot on medium heat, melt the butter. Sprinkle in the flour and stir until combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the evaporated milk and bring to a simmer. Season with salt, pepper, mustard powder, and cayenne. Whisk to incorporate and smooth any lumps. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the pasta to the sauce and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the cheddar, Gruyère, Colby Jack, Gouda, and provolone cheese, then fold the cheeses into the pasta. If it seems too dry, add more milk to your liking. </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer the mixture to a baking dish and top with the shredded mozzarella and cheddar. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 45 minutes, or until the mac ‘n’ cheese is bubbly, melted, and golden brown on top. </step>
    <step num="9">Serve with a sprinkle of the bread crumb mixture for added flavor! </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
