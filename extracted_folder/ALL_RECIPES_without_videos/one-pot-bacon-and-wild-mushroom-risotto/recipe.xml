  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a 5-quart Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the onion and cook 3-4 minutes until soft and slightly transparent. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the bacon and stir constantly until it starts to crisp. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the mushrooms and cook for an additional 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the arborio rice and cook for one minute, stirring constantly so the oil coats the grains. </step>
    <step num="5">Stir in the white wine and simmer 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. </step>
    <step num="6">Add one cup (235ml) of the chicken stock and simmer over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. </step>
    <step num="7">Once the rice absorbs most of the liquid, continue to add 1-2 cups (235-470ml) of stock at a time until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is cooked through, about 25-30 minutes total. </step>
    <step num="8">NOTE: The risotto should be al dente and fall back in on itself when you run the spoon along the bottom of the pot. </step>
    <step num="9">Stir in the Parmesan cheese and remove from the heat. </step>
    <step num="10">Serve and garnish with extra Parmesan cheese. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
