  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). </step>
    <step num="1">Make the filling: Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the the flour and whisk until bubbling. </step>
    <step num="2">Whisk in the milk until smooth, then add the chicken, peas and carrots, pearl onions, potato, salt, and pepper . Stir until everything is well coated, then continue to cook until the filling is bubbling and the liquid has thickened slightly, 7-10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. </step>
    <step num="3">Make the biscuits: In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. </step>
    <step num="4">Using your a fork, your hands, or a pastry cutter, work the butter into the dry ingredients, leaving pea-sized chunks. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the buttermilk and fold with a rubber spatula until a thick dough comes together. </step>
    <step num="6">Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Bring the dough together into one large mass, then roll out with a rolling pin to about 1 ½-2 inches (4-5 centimeters) thick. </step>
    <step num="7">Using a 2-3-inch (5-7 centimeter) biscuit cutter or small glass dipped in flour, cut out rounds from the dough. Cut out all of the rounds, then place on top of the filling so the dough does not warm too much. Re-roll the dough scraps if needed. You should have about 10 biscuits total. </step>
    <step num="8">Brush tops of the biscuits with the beaten egg and top with cheddar cheese. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the biscuits are golden brown and cooked through. Carefully remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes. Garnish with chives before serving. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
