  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">Zest the lemon into a small bowl and set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Juice the lemon and set aside 1 teaspoon for the glaze. Combine the rest with ½ cup (120 ml) of almond milk and set aside for 5-10 minutes while you make the rest of the dough. (The almond milk will curdle, that’s okay! This creates a dairy-free substitute for buttermilk.) </step>
    <step num="3">In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, poppy seeds, and lavender. Whisk well. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the coconut oil and cut it into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter, a fork, or your fingers until the flour mixture is crumbly and there are no large chunks left. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the lemon zest, curdled almond milk, and egg. Fold the ingredients until the dough forms. </step>
    <step num="6">Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle with just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking as you form it into a disc about 1½-2 inches (4-5 cm) thick. </step>
    <step num="7">Cut the dough into 8 triangular scones. Transfer the scones to the prepared baking sheet, spacing evenly. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool. </step>
    <step num="9">Make the glaze: In a small bowl, combine powdered sugar, remaining 1-2 teaspoons of almond milk, and the reserved teaspoon of lemon juice. Whisk until smooth. </step>
    <step num="10">Drizzle the glaze over the cooled scones and let it harden, 5-10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="11">Serve with hot tea. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
