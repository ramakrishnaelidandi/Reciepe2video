  <steps>
    <step num="0">Mix together the ingredients for the Fajita rub. </step>
    <step num="1">Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Toss in the sliced bell peppers and onion, sprinkle over 2 teaspoons of the fajita spice rub, and sauté until soft, about 8 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Using a sharp knife, carefully slice the chicken breast in half. Lay a sheet of plastic wrap over the chicken breast and flatten the meat with a mallet or rolling pin. </step>
    <step num="3">Spread a quarter the sautéed pepper mixture evenly on the chicken breast. Roll the breast and skewer with toothpicks so that the roll holds its shape. </step>
    <step num="4">Slice the roll into ½-inch (1¼ cm) pieces, making sure each piece is held together with a toothpick. </step>
    <step num="5">Season each roll on both sides with the fajita spice rub. </step>
    <step num="6">Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in the skillet and fry the chicken rolls about 3 minutes on each side until fully cooked. </step>
    <step num="7">Let rest 5 minutes before serving. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
