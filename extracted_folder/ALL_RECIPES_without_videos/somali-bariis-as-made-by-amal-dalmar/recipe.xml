  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Make the xawaash: In a medium bowl, combine the cumin, coriander, turmeric, cardamom, black pepper, cloves, and nutmeg. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Heat a medium oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable oil, onion, tomato, garlic, and cinnamon stick. Cook until the onions have softened slightly, 5-6 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Season with salt, then add the vegetable stock cube and cilantro. Cook for 1 minute, breaking up the stock cube. </step>
    <step num="4">Reduce the heat to medium, then stir in the xawaash and soaked rice. Cook for about 3 minutes so rice grains lightly toast. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour in the hot water and increase the heat to high to bring to a boil. Cover the pot, transfer to the oven, and bake for 20 minutes. Check periodically to be sure the rice has enough water. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove the cooked rice from the oven and drizzle the red and orange food colorings on top. Gently mix so there are different colored grains. </step>
    <step num="7">Sprinkle the raisins over the hot rice, cover, and set aside. </step>
    <step num="8">To prepare the topping, mix the potatoes with the orange food coloring in a medium bowl (wear gloves to avoid stained fingers!). </step>
    <step num="9">Heat about 1 inch ( 2 cm) of oil in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the potatoes and cook for 5-6 minutes, then transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain the excess oil. </step>
    <step num="10">In the same oil, fry the onion slices until browned and crispy, 2-3 minutes. Add the red peppers cooking for an additional minute. Drain on paper towels. </step>
    <step num="11">To assemble the rice, transfer the pilaf to a large serving platter. Top with the fried potatoes, crispy onions, and red bell peppers. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
