  <steps>
    <step num="0">To make the flax eggs, combine the flax meal and water in a small bowl and mix well. Set aside for at least 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). </step>
    <step num="2">In a large saucepan, heat a bit of olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the carrot and celery and cook until lightly browned, 2-3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the onion and mushrooms. Cook another 3-4 minutes, until the onions are semi-translucent. </step>
    <step num="4">Add another drizzle of olive oil to the pan, then add the garlic, bell pepper, and tomato paste. Cook for 2 more minutes, until the tomato paste is slightly browned. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the salt, pepper, parsley, and thyme, and cook for 1 more minute, until fragrant. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce and cook for 2 more minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Remove the pan from the heat. </step>
    <step num="7">In a food processor, add the lentils, brown rice, oats, flax eggs, and sautéed vegetables. Pulse 10-12 times until the mixture is slightly chunky. </step>
    <step num="8">Transfer the mixture to a parchment paper-lined loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. </step>
    <step num="9">To make the glaze, combine the ketchup and maple syrup in a small bowl. Brush half of glaze on top of loaf, reserving the other half for later. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake the loaf for 45-50 minutes, or until an fork inserted in the middle comes out clean. </step>
    <step num="11">Brush with the remaining glaze, then slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
