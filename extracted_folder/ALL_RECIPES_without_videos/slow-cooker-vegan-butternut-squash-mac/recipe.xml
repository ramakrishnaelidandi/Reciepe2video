  <steps>
    <step num="0">Cut off both ends of the butternut squash and poke all over with a fork. Microwave on high for 3-4 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Peel the skin off of the squash. The skin should peel right off! Once peeled, slice the squash in half lengthwise, scoop out seeds, and cut into 1-inch (2-cm) cubes. You should have about 5 cups (1 kg). </step>
    <step num="2">In a slow cooker, combine the squash, onion, cashews, nutritional yeast, garlic, rosemary, nutmeg, olive oil, mustard, salt, and vegetable stock. Stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="3">Cover and cook on high for 4 hours or low for 8 hours, until the vegetables are soft enough to be easily mashed with a fork. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the squash mixture to a blender, or use an immersion blender, and puree for 5 minutes, until there are no chunks and the sauce develops a creamy texture. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour the sauce over the macaroni and stir well. </step>
    <step num="6">Serve garnished with parsley. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
