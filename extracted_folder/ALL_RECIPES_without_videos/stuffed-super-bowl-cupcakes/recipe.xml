    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) </step>
    <step num="1">Cream the butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in 4 eggs, one at a time. </step>
    <step num="2">In a separate bowl, mix the flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda. Alternate mixing half of the dry ingredients and buttermilk into the egg mixture. </step>
    <step num="3">Line the bottom of a 9×13 glass dish with parchment paper, and grease. Pour in batter, and bake for 22-25 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">For the filling, mix the marshmallow fluff, butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Set a little aside, and color the rest. </step>
    <step num="5">Cool completely, and with a 2-3 inch cookie cutter or biscuit cutter, cut 12 circles into the cake. </step>
    <step num="6">Cut each cake in half horizontally, and scoop out a little cake out of each side. Fill, and stack the cake with the scooped sides in the middle. </step>
    <step num="7">For the frosting, bring the cream and sugar to a boil, and pour over the chocolate chips and butter. Stir until there are no longer lumps. </step>
    <step num="8">Spread the frosting over the top and sides of each cake. Let dry, flip, and cover the bottom with frosting. </step>
    <step num="9">Pipe a football design on the top of the cake with the filling you set aside. </step>
