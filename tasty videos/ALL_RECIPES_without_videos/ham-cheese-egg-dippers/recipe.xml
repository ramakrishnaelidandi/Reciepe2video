  <steps>
    <step num="0">Fill a small pot two-thirds full with water and bring to a boil. </step>
    <step num="1">With a paring knife, poke a small hole into the wider end of the egg. With a spoon, gently lower eggs into the boiling water and boil for precisely 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Cut the cheddar cheese into strips, 4 inches (10 cm) long, ¼ inch (½ cm) thick. </step>
    <step num="3">Roll out a piece of white bread until flat and dense. </step>
    <step num="4">Place a slice of ham on the bread, then top with a strip of cheddar. Roll up the bread (like a jelly roll) until cheese and ham are entirely covered. </step>
    <step num="5">Fry the bread rolls for about 4 minutes in a buttered sauté pan over medium-high heat. Turn halfway through when rolls are lightly browned. </step>
    <step num="6">When eggs are done, carefully transfer them to a bowl of ice water. </step>
    <step num="7">Meanwhile, use an egg carton to cut out egg holders for each egg. </step>
    <step num="8">Take eggs out of ice water. Serve with the ham and cheese dunkers. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
