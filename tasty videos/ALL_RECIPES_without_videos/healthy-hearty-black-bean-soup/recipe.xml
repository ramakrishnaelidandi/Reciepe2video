  <steps>
    <step num="0">Heat olive oil in a large stock-pot or dutch oven over medium-high heat until the oil begins to shimmer. </step>
    <step num="1">Add onions, celery, carrot, and bell pepper. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to soften. </step>
    <step num="2">Add garlic, salt, and pepper, and continue to cook for an additional 10 minutes until vegetables are soft and the onions are translucent. </step>
    <step num="3">Add cumin, black beans, vegetable stock, and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. </step>
    <step num="4">Cover the pot and cook over low heat for 30 minutes until the beans are very tender. </step>
