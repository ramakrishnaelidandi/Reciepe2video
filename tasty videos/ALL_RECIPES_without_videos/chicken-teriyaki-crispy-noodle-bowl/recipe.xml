  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, add the soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, and cornstarch. Whisk to combine. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="1">Heat a wok or large skillet with 3 inches (7 cm) of oil to 400˚F (200˚C). </step>
    <step num="2">Pull the rice noodles apart into eight portions. </step>
    <step num="3">Place one portion of noodles on a slotted spoon and carefully dip into the oil. The noodles will immediately fry. Once puffed up, remove the noodles and transfer to a wire rack to drain. Repeat with the remaining noodles. </step>
    <step num="4">Season the chicken with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="5">Heat a wok or large skillet with 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the teriyaki sauce to the chicken and bring to a boil. Cook until the sauce has reduced by one third and the chicken is fully coated. </step>
    <step num="7">Serve the chicken over the rice noodles with snap peas, radish slices, scallions, cilantro, and sesame seeds. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
