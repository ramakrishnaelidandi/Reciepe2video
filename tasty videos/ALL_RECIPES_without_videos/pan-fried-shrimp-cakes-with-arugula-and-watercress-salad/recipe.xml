  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the shrimp cakes: Add the shrimp to a food processor and pulse 4-5 times, until minced but not mushy. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, mix together the shrimp, shallot, jalapeño, eggs, panko, chives, lemon zest, paprika, cayenne, a pinch of salt, the lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce until well combined. </step>
    <step num="2">Using a 1-ounce (30-g) scoop, portion out the shrimp mixture and gently flatten into patties. </step>
    <step num="3">Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook the patties, in batches if necessary, for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 145˚F (63˚C). Transfer the cooked patties to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and season lightly with salt. </step>
    <step num="4">Make the roasted red pepper sauce: Add the peppers, red wine vinegar, almonds, shallot, garlic, and a pinch of salt to a blender. Blend for 30 seconds, until smooth. With the blender running, slowly stream in the olive oil to emulsify. Thin with the reserved red pepper liquid, if necessary. </step>
    <step num="5">Assemble the salad: Add the arugula and watercress to a large bowl. Add a drizzle of olive oil, the lemon juice, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss well. </step>
    <step num="6">Divide the salad between serving bowls and top with the shrimp cakes and roasted red pepper sauce. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
