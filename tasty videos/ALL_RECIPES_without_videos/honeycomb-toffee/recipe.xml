  <steps>
    <step num="0">Line a 9"x9" (23cmx23cm) baking dish with parchment paper and grease thoroughly. </step>
    <step num="1">Set aside a metal whisk and one Tablespoon of baking soda. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large saucepan (bigger the better - as this will more than triple in size) over medium/high heat–combine sugar, corn syrup, and water. </step>
    <step num="3">Stir to incorporate, then leave to boil. Insert candy thermometer and continue to heat–without stirring–until the mixture reaches 300˚F (150˚C). </step>
    <step num="4">Remove from heat and ~working quickly~…add the baking soda and quickly whisk into the sugar syrup (whisking for no more than five seconds–to prevent deflating the toffee). The mixture will begin to expand, quickly pour it into the prepared pan and leave to set DO NOT MOVE for one to two hours. </step>
    <step num="5">Once the toffee has cooled and set, remove from pan and using a blunt object, shatter the toffee into bite size pieces. </step>
    <step num="6">Melt chocolate in a microwave safe bowl for 75-90 seconds. Make sure to stop and stir after every 30 seconds. </step>
    <step num="7">Dip the toffee pieces in chocolate and place on a lined baking tray. Finish with a sprinkle of sea salt and place in the refrigerator to cool for 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
