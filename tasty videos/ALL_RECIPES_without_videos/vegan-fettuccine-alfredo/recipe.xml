  <steps>
    <step num="0">Boil 4 cups (945 ml) of water in a small pot. </step>
    <step num="1">Cut a quarter of an onion into cubes. Peel and chop the potatoes into ½ inch (1 cm) cubes. </step>
    <step num="2">Add onion and potatoes to pot and boil for 10 minutes, or until soft. </step>
    <step num="3">Remove potatoes and onion from the pot. Make sure to save the water. </step>
    <step num="4">Begin cooking fettuccine pasta in a separate pot. </step>
    <step num="5">In a blender, combine 1 cup (235ml) of the water used to boil the veggies, raw cashews, veggies, lemon juice, and seasonings. Blend until creamy. Add more of the boiling water if the mixture is too thick. </step>
    <step num="6">Add salt to taste and garlic. </step>
    <step num="7">NOTE: Adding 1 tsp of nutritional yeast, and ¼ tsp truffle oil will really make this dish pop with cheesy flavor! </step>
