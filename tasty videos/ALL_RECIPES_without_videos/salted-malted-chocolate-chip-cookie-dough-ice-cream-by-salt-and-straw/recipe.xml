  <steps>
    <step num="0">To make the ​Malted Cookie Dough, in a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and salt with a wooden spoon until a light paste forms. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the heavy cream, molasses, corn syrup, and vanilla and stir until smooth. </step>
    <step num="2">Sift in the toasted flour and malt powder, then mix until there are no lumps. </step>
    <step num="3">Fold in the chocolate until evenly distributed. </step>
    <step num="4">Spread the cookie dough evenly in a parchment-lined baking dish until it’s about ½-inch (1 cm) thick, then freeze until solid, about 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="5">Cut the cookie dough into ½-inch (1 cm) cubes and freeze for later use. It keeps up to 1 month. </step>
    <step num="6">To make the Molasses Vanilla Ice Cream Base, combine the sugar, dry milk powder, salt, and xanthan gum in a small bowl, and stir well. </step>
    <step num="7">In a medium pot over medium heat, combine the milk, corn syrup, and molasses, whisking until combined. Add the sugar mixture and whisk vigorously until there are no lumps. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the sugar is dissolved, then remove the pot from the heat. </step>
    <step num="8">Pour the mixture into a large liquid measuring cup or medium bowl, then mix in the cream and vanilla. </step>
    <step num="9">Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours before churning. It can be stored in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months. </step>
    <step num="10">To make the malted fudge, mix the water and malt powder together in small pot. Add the corn syrup, heavy cream, butter, and salt. </step>
    <step num="11">Heat the pot over medium-high heat until the butter is completely melted and the mixture comes to a boil. </step>
    <step num="12">Remove the pot from the heat and add the cocoa powder and chopped chocolate, whisking thoroughly until the chocolate is fully melted and the mixture is silky. </step>
    <step num="13">Transfer to an airtight container and store in the fridge for up to 1 week. </step>
    <step num="14">Pour the ice cream base into an ice cream maker and turn on the machine. Churn just until it has the texture of soft serve, 25-35 minutes, depending on the machine. </step>
    <step num="15">Fold in half of the cookie dough cubes until well-distributed. </step>
    <step num="16">Alternate spooning layers of the ice cream and ​a few generous dollops of the fudge into a loaf pan. </step>
    <step num="17">Cover with plastic wrap and store in the coldest part of your freezer for at least 6 hours before scooping and serving. The ice cream will keep up to 6 months. </step>
