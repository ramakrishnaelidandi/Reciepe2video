  <steps>
    <step num="0">Generously butter a 9-inch (23 cm) cast iron or cake pan. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, whisk together warm almond milk, melted coconut oil, and sugar. The mixture should be just warm, registering between 100-110˚F (40˚C). If hotter, allow to cool slightly. </step>
    <step num="2">Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the warm mixture and let sit for 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Add 4 cups (460 g) of whole wheat flour to the milk mixture and mix with a wooden spoon until just combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Cover the bowl with a towel or plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise for 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="5">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="6">In a small bowl combine the applesauce, brown sugar, and cinnamon, and stir to combine. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="7">Remove the towel and add remaining whole wheat flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir well, then turn out onto a well-floured surface. </step>
    <step num="8">Knead the dough lightly until the dough just loses its stickiness and does not stick to the surface. </step>
    <step num="9">Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about ¼-inch (½ cm) thick. Fix corners to make sure they are sharp and even. </step>
    <step num="10">Spread the filling mixture evenly over the rolled out dough, spreading right to the edges. </step>
    <step num="11">Gently roll the dough into a large log and slice it into 1-inch (2 cm) pieces. </step>
    <step num="12">Place the cinnamon rolls in the greased cake pan, leaving some space between them, and bake for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="13">While the cinnamon roll is baking, prepare the frosting. In a medium-size mixing bowl, whisk together the light cream cheese, coconut oil, vanilla extract, almond milk, and maple syrup, until smooth. </step>
    <step num="14">Remove the cinnamon rolls from the oven and let cool in the pan for at least 15 minutes. Once cool, remove from pan and drizzle frosting over the rolls before serving. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
