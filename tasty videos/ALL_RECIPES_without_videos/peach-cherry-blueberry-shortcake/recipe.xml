  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In an 8-inch (20cm) square parchment paper-lined baking dish, arrange the biscuits side by side to cover the bottom of the dish, forming a sheet. </step>
    <step num="2">Bake for 20 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown. </step>
    <step num="3">Slice the peaches, discarding the pits. </step>
    <step num="4">Destem and pit the cherries. </step>
    <step num="5">In a large skillet, combine peaches, cherries, blueberries, ½ cup (125 grams) of the sugar, water, and lemon juice. Heat to a simmer. Cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. </step>
    <step num="6">In a large bowl, beat the heavy cream with a whisk or electric mixer until frothy. Add remaining ¼ cup (62 grams) of sugar. Continue to beat until the whipped cream forms soft peaks. </step>
    <step num="7">Remove the sheet of biscuits from the dish. Slice in half lengthwise, like a bagel. </step>
    <step num="8">Spoon the fruit mixture onto the bottom half of the biscuits, reserving some of the liquid. </step>
    <step num="9">Replace the top half of the biscuits. Carefully separate into individual portions (the syrup will still be quite warm!) </step>
    <step num="10">Spoon whipped cream over the top and drizzle with reserved fruit syrup. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
