    <step num="3">Arrange cheddar slices along the walls and base, overlapping slightly. </step>
    <step num="4">Bake for 30 minutes, or until the crust is lightly golden brown. </step>
    <step num="5">In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, salt, pepper, paprika, bacon, and milk. </step>
    <step num="6">When the crust is par-baked, remove from the oven and place the ham slices along the wall and base of the crust, overlapping slightly. </step>
    <step num="7">Pour the egg mixture into the center. </step>
    <step num="8">Add zucchini slices and cherry tomato halves on top. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 1 hour, or until the center is set. </step>
