  <steps>
    <step num="0">Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat until shimmering. Add the tomato, scallions, onion, garlic, and salt, and cook, stirring occasionally. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the chicken, and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is warmed through. </step>
    <step num="2">For the dough, mash the cooked yucca with a fork in a large bowl. </step>
    <step num="3">Roll a 4-inch (10-cm) ball of yucca and place in the center of a piece of plastic wrap. Add another piece of plastic wrap over the dough and flatten to create a small circle. Roll out to a 6-inch (15-cm) round. </step>
    <step num="4">Scoop 3 tablespoons of the chicken mixture onto the dough and add a couple of pieces of mozzarella over the chicken mixture. Fold over the dough to form an empanada and seal the edges. Repeat with the rest of the dough and filling. </step>
    <step num="5">Heat 2 inches (5 cm) of oil in a large pan over high heat to 350ºF (180ºC). Place the empanadas in the oil and cook for 2-3 minutes or until brown on both sides. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
