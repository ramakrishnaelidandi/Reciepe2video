  <steps>
    <step num="0">Add the butter and peaches to a pan over medium-low heat and cook until the butter has melted and peaches are glossy. </step>
    <step num="1">In a small bowl mix together the brown sugar, cinnamon, 1 tablespoon flour, and nutmeg. Sprinkle the sugar mixture over the peaches. Mix to combine and stir for 5-10 minutes until the mixture starts to thicken. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. </step>
    <step num="2">On a floured surface, roll out the pizza dough to ¼-inch (0.63-cm) thick. Cut the dough into 20 rectangles. </step>
    <step num="3">Spoon 1 tablespoon of the peach filling onto a cut piece of dough. Fold the dough over lengthwise and crimp the edges so the filling is well sealed. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. </step>
    <step num="4">Heat oil in a large pot to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="5">Working in batches, fry beignets for 3-4 minutes each, flipping halfway, until puffy and golden brown. </step>
    <step num="6">Transfer beignets to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. </step>
    <step num="7">Dust with powdered sugar. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
