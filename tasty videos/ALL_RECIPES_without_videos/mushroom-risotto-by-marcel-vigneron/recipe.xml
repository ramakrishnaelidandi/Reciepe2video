  <steps>
    <step num="0">Blend dried shiitake in blender until it becomes a fine powder. </step>
    <step num="1">Pour into a pot filled with filtered water, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Keep broth warm while preparing the risotto. </step>
    <step num="2">Sauté oyster mushrooms in grapeseed oil until brown edges have formed. </step>
    <step num="3">Add thyme, garlic, and 1 tablespoon of butter to help caramelize. Once they have caramelized, salt, to taste, and reserve. </step>
    <step num="4">Sweat the shallots in olive oil until tender, about 5 minutes, then add butter and sushi rice. Toast rice while stirring frequently. </step>
    <step num="5">Add bay leaf, garlic clove, and pour white wine over toasted rice and cook until the wine has been absorbed, then continue stirring. </step>
    <step num="6">Over medium heat, add 2 cups (470 ml) of warm mushroom stock at a time, stirring occasionally and adding more stock as it gets absorbed by the rice. The rice should absorb 6-8 cups (1.4-1.9 liters) of stock. Taste the rice throughout to make sure it cooks just until it is tender, or al dente. </step>
    <step num="7">Add frozen peas and stir. Salt the risotto, to taste, and remove the garlic clove and bay leaf. </step>
    <step num="8">Add ¼ cup (60g) butter, truffle oil, rayu oil, sautéed mushrooms (optional: save some for garnish), pine nuts, and Parmesan. Stir until well incorporated. </step>
    <step num="9">Garnish with reserved mushrooms, pine nuts, wood sorrel, Parmesan, and drizzle with olive oil. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
