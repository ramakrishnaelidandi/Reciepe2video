  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) (Gas Mark 6). </step>
    <step num="1">Dust a clean work surface with a sprinkling of flour, and roll half of the puff pastry into a large circle. </step>
    <step num="2">Place the largest plate you have (a pizza tray also works) on top of the pastry and tear around the edges to create a clean circle. Repeat with the other half of the pastry. </step>
    <step num="3">Fry the onions and mixed peppers until the onions are translucent. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the pre-cooked shredded chicken (to make shredded chicken, simply season and bake some chicken breasts, put it into a bowl and tear it up with 2 forks). Stir in the fajita spice mix and allow to cool while you do the next step. </step>
    <step num="5">Transfer one of the sheets to a baking tray, and spread the chicken fajita mix in an even layer, leaving about 1cm (0.5") free from the edge. Sprinkle a layer of cheese. </step>
    <step num="6">Cover with the second layer of puff pastry. Place an egg cup (or a shot glass) in the center of the pastry and make 8-10 even cuts all the way around the pastry. </step>
    <step num="7">Brush the beaten egg over the puff pastry. </step>
    <step num="8">Twist each segment twice to make it resemble a sun-like shape. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 18-22 minutes in the center of the oven, until deep golden brown and no grey patches remain on the pastry. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
