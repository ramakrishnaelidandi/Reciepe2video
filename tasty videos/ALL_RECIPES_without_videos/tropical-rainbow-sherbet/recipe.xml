  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, using a hand mixer, whip heavy cream until soft peaks form. </step>
    <step num="1">Whisk in condensed milk. Evenly divide the cream base into 3 separate bowls. </step>
    <step num="2">In a saucepan set over medium heat, add raspberries and water. Cook until berries have burst, about 3-5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and cool for 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Place a mesh sieve over one the bowls of cream. Add the raspberries and using a spatula to press on the mixture so that the seeds are caught in the strainer. </step>
    <step num="4">Using a blender, puree mango until smooth. Add mango puree to the second bowl of cream. </step>
    <step num="5">Add pineapple to the third bowl of cream. </step>
    <step num="6">Mix each flavor until uniform in color. </step>
    <step num="7">Alternating each flavor, layer the 3 flavors into a freezer-safe loaf pan. Once all flavors are added, use a butter knife to gently swirl the sherbet. Be careful not to over stir, making more than 5 passes with your knife. </step>
    <step num="8">Freeze until solid, about 3-4 hours. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
