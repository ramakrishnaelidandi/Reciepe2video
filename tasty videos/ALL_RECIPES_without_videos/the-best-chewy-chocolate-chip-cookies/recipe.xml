  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste has formed with no lumps. </step>
    <step num="1">Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk. </step>
    <step num="2">Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula, being careful not to overmix too much. This will cause the gluten in the flour to toughen which will result in cakier cookies. </step>
    <step num="3">Fold in the chocolate chunks evenly, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be. </step>
    <step num="4">Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="5">Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown. </step>
    <step num="7">Cool completely, and serve yourself a glass of milk. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
