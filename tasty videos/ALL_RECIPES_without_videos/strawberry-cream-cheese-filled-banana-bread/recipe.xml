  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a medium bowl, mix the cream cheese, 1 tablespoon of honey, and strawberries until smooth. </step>
    <step num="1">Microwave the cream cheese mixture in 30 second intervals for a total of 5 minutes, stirring between each interval. This helps cook out the moisture so that the mixture doesn’t create a large pocket of steam in the bread. </step>
    <step num="2">Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="3">In a bowl, mash the bananas with a fork. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the eggs and mix until well combined and frothy. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the Greek yogurt and honey, and mix until incorporated. </step>
    <step num="6">Sprinkle in the whole wheat flour, baking soda, and baking powder, and fold the batter together with a spatula. </step>
    <step num="7">Pour ¾ of the banana bread batter into a greased loaf pan, smoothing it into an even layer with the spatula. </step>
    <step num="8">Pour in the cream cheese filling, making sure to keep it away from the edge of the pan. </step>
    <step num="9">Pour the remaining banana bread batter over the cream cheese filling and smooth the top with a spatula. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake for 50-55 minutes, until the top springs back when lightly touched. </step>
    <step num="11">Let the pan cool for 15 minute before removing the loaf from the pan. </step>
    <step num="12">Allow the bread to cool at least 1 hour before slicing and serving. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
