  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over high heat. Add the onion and cook for 10 minutes, until translucent and the edges start to brown. </step>
    <step num="2">Push the onion to one side of the pan and add the red and green bell peppers to the pan. Season with 2 teaspoons of salt, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon of pepper, and cook until the peppers soften, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">Place the steak on the cutting board, and cover with a piece of plastic wrap. Pound with a meat mallet or rolling pin to about ½-inch (1 ¼ cm) thick. </step>
    <step num="4">Remove the plastic wrap and season the steak on both sides with 1 tablespoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of pepper. </step>
    <step num="5">Line 7 slices of Provolone cheese along the bottom edge of the steak. Place the sautéed vegetables on top. </step>
    <step num="6">Starting from the bottom, roll up the steak, encasing the cheese and vegetables inside. </step>
    <step num="7">Top with the remaining 7 slices of Provolone and secure with skewers or toothpicks. </step>
    <step num="8">Transfer the steak roll to a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes, until cheese is melty and the steak is cooked through to your preference. </step>
    <step num="9">Rest for 10 minutes before slicing between the skewers and serving. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
