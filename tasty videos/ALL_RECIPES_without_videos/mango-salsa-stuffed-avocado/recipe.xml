  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat gas grill on high heat. </step>
    <step num="1">Using a sharp knife, slice the avocados in half by cutting in a straight line around the pit. </step>
    <step num="2">Place the avocado half containing the pit in your hand and face it away from you. Gently stick the tip of the knife into the side of the pit and carefully pry it out of the avocado. For a ripe avocado, the pit will pop out with little effort. You can hold a kitchen towel in your hand and place the avocado in the towel for added protection from the edge of your knife. </step>
    <step num="3">Place the avocado halves on a tray. Using a pastry brush, brush oil on each of the avocado halves. </step>
    <step num="4">Place the avocados on the grill, flesh side down, and grill for 3-4 minutes, until grill marks appear. </step>
    <step num="5">Remove the avocados and brush with honey. </step>
    <step num="6">In a small bowl, mix the mango, onions, jalapeños, cilantro, lime juice, and salt until well combined. </step>
    <step num="7">Spoon the salsa into the avocados and serve. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
