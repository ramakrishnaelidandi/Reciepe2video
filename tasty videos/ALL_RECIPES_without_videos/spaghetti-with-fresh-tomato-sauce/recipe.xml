  <steps>
    <step num="0">Cook spaghetti in boiling salted water until it’s al dente. Reserve 1 cup (235 ml) of the pasta water before draining. </step>
    <step num="1">While the spaghetti is cooking, heat olive oil in a large pan (it should be large enough to toss the pasta in). Add garlic and tomatoes, and stir until well-incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="2">Cook tomatoes down for 5 minutes until they soften and release some of their juices. </step>
    <step num="3">Then add the wine and allow that to reduce for 5-10 minutes until you’re left with a syrupy sauce. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the pasta to your sauce, along with a splash of pasta water and toss to coat it for about 1-2 minutes so the pasta finishes cooking and absorbs the flavor of the sauce. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the parmesan and basil. Add another small splash of pasta water, if needed. Toss until the cheese is melted down and you’re left with a smooth sauce. </step>
    <step num="6">Gradually add small amounts of pasta water, as needed, until the sauce reaches your desired smoothness. </step>
    <step num="7">Top off with extra parmesan and basil and serve immediately. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
