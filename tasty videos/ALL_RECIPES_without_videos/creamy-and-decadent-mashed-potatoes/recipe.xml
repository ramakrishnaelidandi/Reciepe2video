    <step num="0">Add the potatoes, bay leaves, garlic, rosemary, and thyme to a large pot. Pour in the cream and milk, bring to a simmer over medium heat, and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Drain the potatoes, reserving the cooking liquid, and discard the herbs and garlic. Press the potatoes through a potato ricer into a large bowl. </step>
    <step num="2">Add about 1½ cups of the reserved cooking liquid to the potatoes and stir until creamy. Add the butter, salt, and pepper, and stir to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="3">Garnish with thyme leaves, if desired. </step>
    <step num="4">Note: You can save any extra cooking liquid and use it to rehydrate leftover mashed potatoes the next day. </step>
    <step num="5">Enjoy! </step>
