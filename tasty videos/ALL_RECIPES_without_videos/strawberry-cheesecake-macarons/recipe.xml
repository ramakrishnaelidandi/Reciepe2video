  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 285ºF (140ºC). </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy. </step>
    <step num="2">Keep beating and slowly add sugar until stiff peaks form. </step>
    <step num="3">Sift powdered sugar and almond flour over the egg whites. </step>
    <step num="4">Fold the dry mixture into the egg whites, giving the bowl a quarter turn every third fold. Make sure to not overmix or the macarons will not rise. </step>
    <step num="5">Once the batter reaches a lava-like consistency, transfer half the batter to another bowl and add the food coloring. Mix until just combined. Do not overmix! </step>
    <step num="6">Working quickly, put the white and pink batters into separate sandwich bags. Cut the corner off of each bag and squeeze the two batters evenly into a larger gallon-size bag or piping bag to create the multicolor effect. </step>
    <step num="7">Pipe 1½-inch (4 cm) dollops onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper (Tip: take a little batter to “glue:” down the edges of the parchment paper so it stays put). </step>
    <step num="8">Let the cookies rest for 30 minutes to an hour, until they are no longer wet to the touch and a skin forms on top. </step>
    <step num="9">While resting, make the filling by mixing the cream cheese, powdered sugar and milk in a bowl until smooth. Transfer to a piping bag and set aside until ready to fill. </step>
    <step num="10">When the cookies are dry to the touch, bake for 13 to 15 minutes until they have risen to form a “foot.” </step>
    <step num="11">Let rest for 10 minutes before filling. To fill, pipe a circle of the cream cheese mixture around the edge of one cookie and place a small dollop of jam in the center. Sandwich with another macaron. </step>
    <step num="12">Macarons are best kept refrigerated until serving. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
