  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Grease 2 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pans with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine the melted ice cream, cake mix, and egg whites. Whisk until smooth. </step>
    <step num="2">Divide the cake batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake according to the package instructions, about 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Place 1 cake on a cake stand or platter. Spread an even layer of frosting over the cake. Top with the other cake layer. Spread a thin layer of frosting over the top and sides of the cake. </step>
    <step num="4">Chill the cake in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Use the remaining frosting to coat the top and sides of the cake. Place the cake over a baking sheet to catch any excess cookies. Use your hand to coat the sides of the cake with crushed mint cookies. </step>
    <step num="6">Slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
