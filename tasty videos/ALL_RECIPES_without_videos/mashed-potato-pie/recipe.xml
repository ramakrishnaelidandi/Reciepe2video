  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Place butter crackers in a food processor and blend until they are a fine, sandy texture. Transfer to a small mixing bowl. </step>
    <step num="2">Add egg and melted butter to the crumbled crackers. Stir until crumbs become a clumpy, wet sand texture. Place the cracker mixture in the base of a 9-inch (22-inch) pie dish to create the crust. </step>
    <step num="3">Use a measuring cup to smooth the surface. Once the surface is smooth, use a fork to prick the base and sides of the crust. </step>
    <step num="4">Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Mash russet potatoes in a large mixing bowl. Once thoroughly mashed, add butter, ¼ cup(60 gram) sour cream, milk, salt and pepper and mix together with large spoon or spatula. </step>
    <step num="6">Spread half of the mashed potatoes over the cooled cracker crust, about ¼-inch in thickness. </step>
    <step num="7">Cover mashed potatoes with a layer of cheddar cheese, making sure to save some for the top. </step>
    <step num="8">Spread the other half of mashed potatoes over the cheese layer. Sprinkle bacon bits and remaining cheese over the top. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="10">Serve with sour cream and green onions. </step>
