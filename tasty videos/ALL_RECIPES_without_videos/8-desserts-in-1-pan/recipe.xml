  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 300째F (150째C). </step>
    <step num="1">Spray a baking tray with cooking spray, then line it with a piece of parchment that extends past the sides. These will be the handles to lift out the dessert. </step>
    <step num="2">Visually dividing the pan into 8 equal rectangles, shape the chocolate chip cookie dough into a flat, even, rectangular shape that fits the divided section in the top left corner, making sure the edges are as straight and sharp as possible. </step>
    <step num="3">Shape the m&amp;m cookie dough into a similar rectangle in the section diagonally across from the chocolate chip cookie dough. </step>
    <step num="4">Break the graham cracker sheets along their seams into pieces that are just as long as the cookie dough rectangles. Press them to form a wall in the bottom left section. </step>
    <step num="5">Place 2 full graham cracker sheets in bottom of the section. </step>
    <step num="6">Layer the chocolate evenly on top. </step>
    <step num="7">Spread the marshmallows across the chocolate. </step>
    <step num="8">In the section directly to the right of the chocolate chip cookie dough, carefully spread the brownie batter into a similar rectangular shape. </step>
    <step num="9">Roll two of the pie crusts together with about a 3-inch overlap, then trim it into a rectangle. </step>
    <step num="10">On the far right side of the pan, lay the rectangular sheet of pie crust over where the 2 rightmost sections would be. Press the pie crust into the edges of the pan, then trim off any excess that goes beyond the pan. </step>
    <step num="11">Place a double layer strip of pie crust in the middle, creasing the dough near the bottom into the pie crust that was laid down in order to help it stick and stay up. </step>
    <step num="12">Seal off the left exposed edge of the pie crust with another double strip of pie crust. You should now have 2 rectangles completely enclosed in pie crust. </step>
    <step num="13">If the brownie mix has spread a little bit, push it back into its original rectangular shape. </step>
    <step num="14">Add the apple pie filling to the bottom right square. </step>
    <step num="15">Add the pumpkin pie filling to the top right square. </step>
    <step num="16">Immediately spread the banana bread batter into the section between the brownie and the pie crust. </step>
    <step num="17">Breaking another graham cracker sheet into pieces, form another wall along the bottom of the banana bread rectangle and the right of the m&amp;m cookie dough. </step>
    <step num="18">Lay down 2 more sheets of graham crackers inside that rectangle to form a base, then evenly spread the cheesecake batter on top. </step>
    <step num="19">Bake for 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="20">Cool completely, then slowly and carefully lift the entire dessert out using the parchment paper handles. Immediately transfer to a large cutting board. </step>
    <step num="21">Make 8 evenly-spaced slices vertically and 4 slices horizontally, creating bars that are have 1, 2, or 4 flavors. </step>
    <step num="22">Enjoy! </step>
