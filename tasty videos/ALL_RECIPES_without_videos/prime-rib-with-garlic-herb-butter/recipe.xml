  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 500°F (260°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Mix together the butter, garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper in a bowl until evenly combined. </step>
    <step num="2">Rub the herb butter all over the rib roast, then place on a roasting tray with a rack. </step>
    <step num="3">Bake for 5 minutes per pound (10 minutes per kilo) of meat, so a 5-pound (2.2 kg) roast would bake for 25 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Turn off the heat and let the rib roast sit in the oven for 2 hours, making sure you do not open the oven door or else the residual heat will escape. </step>
    <step num="5">Once the 2 hours are up, remove the roast from the pan and pour the pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the flour, whisking until there are no lumps, then add the beef stock, stirring and bringing the sauce to a boil. </step>
    <step num="7">Remove from heat and strain the sauce into a gravy dish. </step>
    <step num="8">Carve the prime rib into ¾-inch (20 mm) slices. </step>
    <step num="9">Serve with the mashed potatoes, green beans, and sauce! </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
