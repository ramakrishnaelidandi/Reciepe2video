    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 450ºF (230ºC), and line a sheet tray with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, mix the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes, or until the mixture becomes cloudy and slightly foamy. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the flour, salt, and 1 tablespoon of oil to the bowl with the yeast mixture and stir until combined. </step>
    <step num="3">Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 3-5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Wipe the large bowl clean and lightly coat with remaining oil. Place the dough into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a dish towel </step>
    <step num="5">Set in a warm place for 20 minutes, or until the dough has nearly doubled in size. </step>
    <step num="6">Once risen, turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and stretch the dough into a 12x22-inch (30x56 cm) rectangle. </step>
    <step num="7">Layer the ham and provolone in the center of the rectangle, lengthwise, leaving 1-2 inches (2 ½-5 cm) on the top and bottom. </step>
    <step num="8">Slice the dough in half through the center, lengthwise. </step>
    <step num="9">Fold each piece’s center edge towards the outer edge and pat down, creating a long roll-up. </step>

    <step num="11">Brush the tops with olive oil and sprinkle with Parmesan. </step>
    <step num="12">Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until light golden brown. </step>
