  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the crust: In a large bowl, mix together ¾ cup (95 g) all-purpose flour, the whole wheat flour, and salt. Add the butter and, using a pastry cutter, work it into the flour until only pea-sized pieces remain. Continue working with your hands until the dough is shaggy. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the water, starting with 3 tablespoons, and mix until the dough is moist enough to hold together. Add more water as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time. Form the dough into a disc and wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30–60 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="3">While the dough is resting, make the filling: In a medium bowl, combine the blackberries, cherries, peaches, sugar, and remaining 2 tablespoons of flour. Toss to coat the fruit. </step>
    <step num="4">Assemble the crostata: On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to a 12-inch (30 cm) wide circle, about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick. Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="5">Spoon the fruit filling into the center of the dough, leaving a 2-inch (5 cm) border around the edges. Fold the edges of the crust up and over the filling to create a rustic look. Brush the crust with the beaten egg and sprinkle with sugar. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 45–50 minutes until the crust is golden brown. </step>
    <step num="7">Let cool for 10–15 minutes before slicing and serving. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
