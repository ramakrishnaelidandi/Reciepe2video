  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 450˚F (230˚C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">On a cutting board, slice the potatoes into matchsticks by quartering lengthwise. Cut the quarters lengthwise into ¼-inch slices, then cut into ¼-inch (6 mm) matchsticks. </step>
    <step num="2">Place the potatoes in a large bowl. Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of salt and ½ teaspoon of pepper. Toss to coat. </step>
    <step num="3">Arrange the fries evenly in 2 rows on each baking sheet so they are not touching. </step>
    <step num="4">Bake for 25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="5">In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the butter and flour. Whisk until the mixture is a golden brown. Add the beef stock, Worcestershire, remaining ½ teaspoon of salt and remaining ½ teaspoon of pepper. Bring to a boil, whisking continuously. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the water to the cornstarch in a small bowl and mix until dissolved. Add the cornstarch slurry to the gravy and stir until thickened. Remove from the heat and cover to keep the gravy hot. </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer the baked fries to a large bowl, add the cheese curds, and pour the hot gravy over the top. Toss to coat. </step>
    <step num="8">Transfer to a dish and serve immediately. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
