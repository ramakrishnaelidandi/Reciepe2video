  <steps>
    <step num="0">Tear up the two slices of bread and blend into soft breadcrumbs. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the breadcrumbs, grated potato, grated cheddar cheese, spring onions, egg and salt and pepper to a large bowl and mix until properly combined. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the marmite and a splash of water to a small bowl and microwave until slightly runny. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">Dust the surface with plan flour and roll out 500g (2 cups) of shortcrust pastry into a rectangular shape the thickness of a pound coin. </step>
    <step num="4">Use a 15-16cm (6 in) diameter bowl to cut out circles of the pastry. </step>
    <step num="5">Brush the marmite in a circle in the middle of the circle, leaving a 2-3cm (1 in) border around the edge. Add 2-3 tbsp of the potato filling on top. </step>
    <step num="6">Brush the border with egg wash and fold over into a semi circle shape, making sure it is sealed. </step>
    <step num="7">Crimp the sealed edges so that the filling is extra secure. Brush with more egg wash. </step>
    <step num="8">Re-roll any leftover pastry to make more! </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for around 50 mins at 150°C (300°F) until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
