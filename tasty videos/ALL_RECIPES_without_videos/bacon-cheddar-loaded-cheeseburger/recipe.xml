  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a pan over medium-high heat, add the bacon, and cook until crispy. Transfer to a cutting board and roughly chop. </step>
    <step num="1">In a bowl, add the bacon, cream cheese, green onions, and shredded cheddar. Mix well. </step>
    <step num="2">Divide the ground beef into four even portions and shape into balls. Form a well into the center of each, large enough for the cheese mixture. </step>
    <step num="3">Place a quarter of the cheese mixture into the center of each ball, and enclose inside the ground beef. Gently press each ball into a patty shape, and season both sides generously with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="4">Heat a cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the burgers and cook for 4-5 minutes on one side. </step>
    <step num="5">Flip the burgers, and cook for 2 minutes. Add a slice of cheese on each burger and cook for an additional 2 minutes, until the burger is cooked through and the cheese is melted. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove burgers from pan, and place on top a toasted burger bun. Top with condiments of your choice. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
