    <step num="4">Add milk and cream. Bring to a light boil, stirring frequently, until mixture thickens. Remove from heat. </step>
    <step num="5">Cut thawed pastry dough into 3-inch (7.5 cm) squares. </step>
    <step num="6">Place in a greased muffin tray. </step>
    <step num="7">Fill with ¼ cup cheesesteak mix and bake for 10-12 minutes at 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="8">Take out of oven and cover with grated provolone cheese. Return to oven until cheese is melted. </step>
