  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Spray a 9x9-inch (23x23 cm) baking pan with cooking spray. </step>
    <step num="2">Take 5 of the graham crackers and arrange them in the pan, breaking some of them to fill in the gaps. </step>
    <step num="3">Crush the remaining graham cracker and set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour the vanilla cake batter on the graham cracker base. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 25-30 minutes until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. </step>
    <step num="6">Using the back of a wooden spoon, poke 4 rows of 4 holes in the cake, making 16 holes total. </step>
    <step num="7">In a large bowl, mash strawberries with a whisk until very fine. </step>
    <step num="8">Add cream cheese and condensed milk, whisking until there are no large lumps. </step>
    <step num="9">Add the milk, stirring until smooth. </step>
    <step num="10">Pour the mixture over the cake and set until the cake has absorbed as much of the mixture as it can. Some of the mixture will still stay on top, which is okay. </step>
    <step num="11">Spread the whipped topping evenly on top. </step>
    <step num="12">Chill the cake anywhere from 3 hours to overnight. </step>
    <step num="13">Slice, and serve with strawberries and the reserved graham cracker crumbs. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
