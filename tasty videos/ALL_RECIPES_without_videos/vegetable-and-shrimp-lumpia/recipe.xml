  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the sweet chili sauce: In a small pot over medium heat, mix together ½ cup (120 ml) of water, the garlic, Fresno chilies, sugar, rice vinegar, and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and remaining tablespoon of water. </step>
    <step num="2">Whisk the cornstarch slurry into the sauce until fully incorporated. Continue to simmer for 1 minute, or until the mixture has thickened. Remove from the heat and let cool. </step>
    <step num="3">Make the lumpia: Julienne the carrots. Cut the green beans on the diagonal. </step>
    <step num="4">In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for 3 minutes or until slightly tender. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the garlic and ginger, and continue cooking for 2 minutes more, until fragrant. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the carrots and green beans, and toss to combine. Add the shrimp, fish sauce, salt, pepper, and rice vinegar, and cook for 2 minutes or until shrimp is pink. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the bean sprouts, toss to incorporate, and remove the pan from the heat. </step>
    <step num="8">Lay out a lumpia wrapper in a diamond shape and spoon 2 tablespoons of filling onto the bottom of the wrapper, leaving about 1½ inches (4 cm) of space from the bottom point. </step>
    <step num="9">Fold the bottom point over the filling, then fold in the edges to create an envelope shape. Roll the wrapper toward the top point. Brush the top point with egg wash and finish the roll to seal the end. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. </step>
    <step num="10">In a large, deep skillet, heat 1 inch (2.5 cm) of canola oil to 300°F (150°C). </step>
    <step num="11">Carefully add 4-5 lumpia at a time to the hot oil. Fry on each side for 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown. Note: If the lumpia are cooking too quickly or burning, reduce the heat. Remove the lumpia from the oil and drain on a wire rack or paper towels. </step>
    <step num="12">Garnish with cilantro and serve with the sweet chili sauce. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
