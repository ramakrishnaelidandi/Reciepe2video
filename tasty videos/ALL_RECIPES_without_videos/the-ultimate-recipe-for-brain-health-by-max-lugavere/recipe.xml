  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Spread the Brussels sprouts on a small baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and season with ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Toss to coat. </step>
    <step num="2">Bake for 45–50 minutes, or until the sprouts are browned and crispy. </step>
    <step num="3">While the Brussels are roasting, marinate the salmon: In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of olive oil, ⅛ teaspoon salt, ⅛ teaspoon pepper, and the brown mustard. </step>
    <step num="4">Place the salmon, skin-side down, in a glass baking dish and pour the mustard mixture over it. Spread the mixture evenly over the salmon, then marinate at room temperature for 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Just before the salmon is finished marinating, prepare the arugula salad: In a medium bowl, toss the arugula with the lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and ¼ teaspoon salt, or to taste. </step>
    <step num="6">Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a medium pan over medium heat. Pan fry the salmon for about 4 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your desired level of doneness. Transfer to a serving plate. </step>
    <step num="7">Sprinkle the Brussels sprouts with the mustard seed powder and plate with the salmon and arugula. Squeeze a bit of lemon juice over the salmon. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
