    <step num="0">Peel the tomatoes: bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Prepare an ice bath in a large bowl and set nearby. Carefully place the tomatoes in the boiling water. Boil for 30 seconds, or until the skin begins to split. Carefully transfer the tomatoes with a slotted spoon to the ice bath. Once cool enough to handle, gently peel the skins off and discard. Chop the tomatoes, discarding the seeds. </step>
