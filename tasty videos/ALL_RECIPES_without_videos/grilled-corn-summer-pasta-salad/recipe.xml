  <steps>
    <step num="0">Microwave the corn on a microwave-safe plate on high for 7 minutes. Remove from the microwave, and grip the corn with a dish towel. Then cut off the bottom end with a serrated knife. Slide the corn out of the husk. It should come out fairly easily with none of the silky string mess. </step>
    <step num="1">Brush the corn with olive oil, then place on a cast iron grill pan or outdoor grill over medium-high heat. Grill for 5-6 minutes on each side, until the kernels are slightly charred. </step>
    <step num="2">Insert the narrow end of an ear of corn into the center hole of a bundt pan. Holding the corn steady with one hand, saw off the kernels with a serrated knife. The kernels will fall into the pan for easy collection. </step>
    <step num="3">Make the cilantro-lime vinaigrette: Combine the cilantro, olive oil, lime juice, garlic, chili powder, honey, salt, and pepper in a food processor and blend until smooth. </step>
    <step num="4">In a large bowl, add the pasta, corn, tomatoes, red onion, avocado, and vinaigrette, and mix until well-combined. </step>
    <step num="5">Enjoy! </step>
