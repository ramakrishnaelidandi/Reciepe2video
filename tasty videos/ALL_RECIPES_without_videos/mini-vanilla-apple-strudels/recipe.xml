  <steps>
    <step num="0">Peel and dice apples and put them in a large bowl. Set apple peel aside for decoration, if desired. </step>
    <step num="1">Add lemon juice, sugar, and almonds, and mix. </step>
    <step num="2">Roll out half of the puff pastry until thin, and cut into three even, long slices. Coat the slices with cream. </step>
    <step num="3">Spread half the apple mixture on all three slices, covering three quarters and leaving about an inch (2 ½ cm) empty at the sides. </step>
    <step num="4">Brush all the edges except the bottom one with water. </step>
    <step num="5">Roll the dough over the apple mixture from bottom to top, until you have even rolls. Pinch the sides of the rolls to seal them with dough. </step>
    <step num="6">Cut rolls in the middle and transfer with the closed side down into a greased muffin pan. Repeat with second half of puff pastry and apple mixture until you have 12 strudels. </step>
    <step num="7">Mix vanilla powder with half of the milk described in package, usually 1 ½ cups (355 ml). </step>
    <step num="8">Pour 2-3 tablespoons into each strudel. </step>
    <step num="9">Spread egg wash over strudels. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake at 400˚F(200˚C) for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="11">Take strudels out of the pan and dust with powdered sugar. The leftover apple peel can be rolled into “roses” for decoration. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
