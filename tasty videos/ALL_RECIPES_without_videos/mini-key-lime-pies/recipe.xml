  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 325°F (170°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Make the filling: Whisk the egg yolks and lime zest in a medium bowl until tinted light green, about 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Beat in the lime juice and condensed milk, then set aside at room temperature to thicken. </step>
    <step num="3">Make the crust: Crush the graham crackers in a zip-top bag, then mix in the sugar and butter. Divide the crumbs between a 6-cup muffin tin and press down to form crusts. </step>
    <step num="4">Bake for 8 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool for 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour filling into the crusts, then bake until the center is slightly jiggly, 15-17 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate until chilled, 2-3 hours. </step>
    <step num="7">Make the whipped cream: In a large bowl, beat the heavy cream with an electric hand mixer and slowly add the sugar. Once soft peaks form, add the lime zest, then whip until firm peaks form. </step>
    <step num="8">Top the mini pies with whipped cream. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
