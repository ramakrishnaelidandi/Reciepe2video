  <steps>
    <step num="0">Use a fork to poke holes into 1 sweet potato. Wrap the sweet potato in a damp paper towel and microwave on high for 10-12 minutes, until fork-tender. </step>
    <step num="1">Peel and dice the other sweet potato into 1-centimeter (½ inch) cubes. </step>
    <step num="2">Carefully scoop the pulp of the cooked sweet potato into a food processor or blender. Add about 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and blend under smooth. Add a splash of water if the puree is too thick. </step>
    <step num="3">In a pan over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the mushrooms. Cook until the mushrooms start to crisp, about 3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Add 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper to the mushrooms and remove from the heat. Drain the mushrooms of excess oil in a paper towel-lined bowl. </step>
    <step num="5">Add 6 tablespoons of the butter and sage to the pan and cook until brown bits start to form on the bottom, being very careful to not burn the butter. </step>
    <step num="6">Once slightly brown, remove the sage and add the cubed sweet potato and 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Cook about 5 minutes, until the potato becomes tender. </step>
    <step num="7">Stir in the reserved purée and chicken stock. Simmer for two minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly and the mixture comes together smoothly. </step>
    <step num="8">Add the penne and mushrooms and coat evenly in the sauce. </step>
    <step num="9">Finish the pasta with 1 tablespoon butter, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and sherry wine vinegar, stirring to combine. Remove from heat and stir in the Parmesan cheese. </step>
    <step num="10">Serve warm, garnished with chives, crushed amaretti cookies, and more Parmesan. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
