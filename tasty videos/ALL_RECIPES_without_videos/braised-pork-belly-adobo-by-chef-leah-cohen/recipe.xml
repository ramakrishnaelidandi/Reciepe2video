  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 325˚F (160˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Cut the pork belly in half crosswise and place in a Dutch oven or large oven-safe pot. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, combine the salt, sugar, pepper, star anise, garlic, bay leaves, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, and water. Whisk until the salt and sugar have dissolved. </step>
    <step num="3">Pour the braising liquid over the pork belly. Cover the pork belly with a sheet of parchment paper, then tightly cover the pot with a sheet of aluminum foil. Bake for 2-2½ hours, until the pork is tender but not falling apart. </step>
    <step num="4">Remove the pork belly from the braising liquid and transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Chill uncovered in the refrigerator overnight. </step>
    <step num="5">Make the adobo sauce: In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine the water, soy sauce, sugar, canola oil, bay leaf powder, black pepper, garlic, coconut vinegar, and coconut milk. Simmer for 15-20 minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat and reserve until ready to use. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove the pork belly from the refrigerator and cut it into approximately 8 5-ounce (140 g) pieces. Score the pork by slicing through the fat cap, stopping once you reach the meat, in ½-inch (1 cm) sections. </step>
    <step num="7">Fill a large pot halfway with the oil and heat until it reaches 375˚F (190˚C). </step>
    <step num="8">Fry the pork belly until the skin is crispy and the center is hot, about 8 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Slice the pork belly between the scores. </step>
    <step num="10">To serve, ladle some adobo sauce on the bottom of a serving bowl. Arrange a portion of pork belly on top and garnish with a poached egg, Szechuan pepper, scallions, fried garlic, and cilantro. Serve with Jasmine rice alongside. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
