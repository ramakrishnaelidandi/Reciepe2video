  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Place the pie crust on a cutting board, and cut out circle shapes using the top of a coffee cup. Collect scrap pieces, and roll out again to stamp out more shapes, making 12-14 circles total. </step>
    <step num="2">Fill half the circles with a tablespoon of the cream cheese, followed by a heaping teaspoon of jam. </step>
    <step num="3">Using your finger, lightly wet the edges of the cut rounds with water. </step>
    <step num="4">Cover the tops with the remaining circles, pressing the two dough halves together. Crimp edges with a fork to seal. </step>
    <step num="5">In a bowl, beat the egg with water. Brush the tops of the pies with the egg wash. </step>
    <step num="6">Use a small, sharp knife to cut a ventilation hole, or slit into the top of the pies. </step>
    <step num="7">Arrange the pies on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 15-20 minutes until golden brown. Allow to cool completely before serving. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
