  <steps>
    <step num="0">Peel the apples and soak them in a medium bowl filled with lemon water to keep then from browning. Using a cheese grater, grate the apples. </step>
    <step num="1">In another medium bowl, combine the grated apples and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. Stir to coat well and set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Make the churro dough: In a medium saucepan over high heat, combine the butter, brown sugar, salt, and water. Bring to a boil. </step>
    <step num="3">Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the flour. Using a wooden spoon, stir until the dough comes together to form a ball, about 1 minute. </step>
    <step num="4">Remove the pot from the heat and let cool for about 5 minutes to prevent accidentally cooking the eggs. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the eggs, 1 at a time, being sure to fully incorporate each egg before adding the next. Set the dough aside. </step>
    <step num="6">Spread a kitchen towel over a medium bowl. Transfer the grated apple to the towel and squeeze to remove moisture. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the grated apple to the churro dough. Mix well with wooden spoon and transfer to a piping bag with a large star tip or large round tip. </step>
    <step num="8">Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="9">Pipe the dough into the hot oil, using scissors to cut into bite-size pieces as you squeeze. Work in batches, if necessary, so as not to overcrowd the pot. Fry the churros until golden brown and fully cooked, 2-3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="10">Transfer the hot churros to a medium bowl filled with cinnamon sugar and toss to coat. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
