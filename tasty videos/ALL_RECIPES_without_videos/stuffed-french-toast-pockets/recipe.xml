  <steps>
    <step num="0">Mix the filling ingredients together in a small bowl until consistency is smooth. Chill 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C). </step>
    <step num="2">Roll each slice of bread flat with a mason jar or rolling pin. </step>
    <step num="3">Put about 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of a slice. Place another slice directly on top, as if you were making a sandwich. </step>
    <step num="4">NOTE: Be careful not to press down on the center so the filling doesn’t spread. </step>
    <step num="5">Using a wide-mouth mason jar lid or biscuit/cookie cutter, press firmly down on the sandwich and remove the crust around the lid. </step>
    <step num="6">Use a knife to refine the edges of the circle. Gently release pocket from lid. </step>
    <step num="7">Press down firmly on the outer edges of the pocket with a fork to make indentations. </step>
    <step num="8">Repeat steps 3-8 for each pocket. Set pockets aside. </step>
    <step num="9">Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Place baking rack on top of parchment paper and coat with cooking spray. </step>
    <step num="10">Whisk eggs, milk, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a small bowl. </step>
    <step num="11">Separately dip each pocket in egg mixture, flipping to ensure it gets entirely coated. Let excess drip off. </step>
    <step num="12">Arrange 4 pockets on baking rack. Bake for 15-25 minutes or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="13">Let cool 5-10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="14">Garnish with powdered sugar and syrup. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
