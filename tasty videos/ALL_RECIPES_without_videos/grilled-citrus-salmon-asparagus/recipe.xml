  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a resealable bag or dish, add salmon, olive oil, salt, pepper, juice of one lemon, minced garlic, one thyme sprig, and one rosemary sprig. </step>
    <step num="1">Seal, mix marinade around, being careful not to bruise the fish, and allow to marinate in the refrigerator for at least one hour. </step>
    <step num="2">Preheat only half of the grill to medium-high heat for indirect grilling. </step>
    <step num="3">Slice the two remaining lemons horizontally, so that you get six slices of lemon from each one, excluding the top and bottom. </step>
    <step num="4">Bend each piece of asparagus until the woody end snaps off and discard it. </step>
    <step num="5">Oil the grill with olive oil and place lemon slices over indirect heat (the side of the grill where the burners are not on). </step>
    <step num="6">Lay salmon on top of the lemon slices and top with a sprig of rosemary on each fillet. Close the cover and grill for 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Place the asparagus spears on the grill and brush with olive oil. Grill for 5 additional minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">Sprinkle with parsley and serve. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
