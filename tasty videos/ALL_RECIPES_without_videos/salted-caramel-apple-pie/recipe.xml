  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine the apple slices, lemon juice, flour, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Toss until the apples are well coated. </step>
    <step num="2">Lay 1 of the pie crusts in a 9-inch (23-cm) pie dish. Add the apple slices to the bottom of the crust. Place the other pie crust over the apple slices. </step>
    <step num="3">Trim any extra dough from the edges. Press the rounded edge of spoon facedown around the edge, making shallow indentations to crimp the crusts together. </step>
    <step num="4">Cut 4 slits in the top of the pie for ventilation, then brush with the beaten egg. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake the pie for 50-60 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and no grey-ish or undercooked pastry remains. Let cool completely. </step>
    <step num="6">In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, brown sugar, and honey. Cook over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Whisk in the butter and bring to a boil. </step>
    <step num="8">Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the caramel reaches a thick consistency. </step>
    <step num="9">Let the caramel sauce cool for 5 minutes, then pour over the pie. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt. </step>
    <step num="10">Slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
