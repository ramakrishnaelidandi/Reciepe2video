    <step num="0">In a medium bowl, beat the eggs. </step>
    <step num="1">Melt the butter in a medium frying pan over medium heat. </step>
    <step num="2">Pour in the beaten eggs. Stir and shake the pan, moving the eggs around until a few curds form. Reduce the heat to low, then flatten the eggs until the still-runny egg covers the entire bottom of the pan. Add any fillings that you would like. </step>
    <step num="3">Let the omelette cook until the eggs are fully set, 1-2 minutes, then gently roll the omelette and transfer to a plate. The surface should be smooth with no color. </step>
    <step num="4">Sprinkle with chives, if desired. </step>
