  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). </step>
    <step num="1">With a sharp knife, score a ring around each potato, just deep enough to break the skin. Place the potatoes in a medium pot of cold water. Bring to a boil and cook for about 8 minutes, until about halfway cooked. </step>
    <step num="2">Drain the potatoes, and rinse with cold water. Peel off the skin. </step>
    <step num="3">Cut the potatoes into ½-inch (1 cm) pieces and set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">Divide the eggplant and bell peppers between 2 baking sheets and spread in an even layer. Drizzle with 4 tablespoons of olive oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Toss with your hands to coat. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 25 minutes, flipping halfway through. </step>
    <step num="6">Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion and cook for 3-4 minutes, until semi-translucent. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the tomato paste and stir until well distributed, then add the garlic, paprika, 1 teaspoon salt, and ¾ teaspoon pepper, and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until fragrant. </step>
    <step num="8">Add the potatoes, chickpeas, and tomatoes, and stir to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="9">Stir in the vegetable broth and cover. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 20 minutes, until the potatoes are tender. </step>
    <step num="10">Add the roasted eggplant and bell pepper, and stir to combine. Cook for another 5-10 minutes, until the tomatoes have mostly broken down. </step>
    <step num="11">Ladle into bowls, garnish with parsley, and serve. Or, transfer the stew to resealable containers and store in the fridge for up to 5 days or freezer for up to 3 months. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
