  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, whisk together all of the filling ingredients until smooth. </step>
    <step num="1">Cut the oranges in half and squeeze the juice out while keeping the skin intact as much as you can. </step>
    <step num="2">Fill each orange half with the filling and then freeze for at least one hour. (Placing them in small dishes on a baking tray will help keep their shape, but they will probably be fine if you don’t have enough little dishes). </step>
    <step num="3">Soften for 15-30 minutes at room temperature before serving. </step>
    <step num="4">Enjoy! </step>
