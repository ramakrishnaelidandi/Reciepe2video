  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine brownie mix, egg, oil, and water until creamy. </step>
    <step num="2">Pour the brownie batter into a parchment-lined springform pan. </step>
    <step num="3">Bake for 25-30 minutes, until center no longer wobbles. </step>
    <step num="4">Leave the brownie base in the pan to cool completely. </step>
    <step num="5">Whip the heavy cream until it makes soft peaks. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour water into a saucepan about half-full, and bring to a gentle simmer. Place a heat-safe bowl over the pot. </step>
    <step num="7">NOTE: The bowl should be bigger than the saucepan so that the bottom of the bowl doesn’t come in contact with the simmering water. </step>
    <step num="8">Add the chocolate pieces to the bowl and stir frequently until smooth. Set aside. (Be careful – the bowl may be hot.) </step>
    <step num="9">NOTE: make sure the water isn’t boiling, or you can burn the chocolate. </step>
    <step num="10">Separate the eggs and beat the egg whites until blended. </step>
    <step num="11">In a second heat-safe bowl, whisk the egg yolks until blended. </step>
    <step num="12">Just like with the chocolate, place the bowl with the egg mixture on top of the gently simmering water, whisking heavily for about 2 minutes until it has a lighter color and a creamy texture. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="13">Whisk granulated sugar into the egg mixture. Slowly stir in the melted chocolate. </step>
    <step num="14">Carefully fold in the egg whites and the whipped cream until blended. </step>
    <step num="15">Spread the chocolate mousse over the cooled brownie base in the springform pan. </step>
    <step num="16">In a glass bowl, microwave the white chocolate in 15-second increments and stir until melted. </step>
    <step num="17">Pour the white chocolate into a plastic bag. Cut off the tip of one of the bag's corners. </step>
    <step num="18">Drizzle white chocolate all over the cake. </step>
    <step num="19">Using a toothpick or skewer, swirl white chocolate into the mousse in small circular motions to make a marbled pattern. </step>
    <step num="20">Freeze overnight, or at least 6-8 hours. </step>
    <step num="21">Enjoy! </step>
