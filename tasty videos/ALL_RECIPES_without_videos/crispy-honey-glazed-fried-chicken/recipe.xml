    <step num="0">In a medium bowl, add the salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, cumin, oregano, and cayenne and mix until combined. </step>
    <step num="1">Pour half of the spice mix into the flour, mixing until the spices are evenly distributed throughout the flour. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the chicken to a bowl, and sprinkle the remaining spice blend over it. Mix until all the chicken pieces are evenly coated. </step>
    <step num="3">Pour the buttermilk over the chicken, and stir until the residual spices from the chicken have blended in with the buttermilk to create a light orange color. </step>
    <step num="4">Marinate the chicken in the fridge for 2 to 8 hours. </step>
    <step num="5">Heat oil to about 325°F (170°C) in a large cast iron skillet. </step>
    <step num="6">Dredge each piece of chicken into the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip them back into the buttermilk mixture, then back into the flour. Make sure to shake off excess flour or it’ll burn while frying. </step>
