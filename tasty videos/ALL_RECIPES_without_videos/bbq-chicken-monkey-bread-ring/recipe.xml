  <steps>
    <step num="0">Cut the pizza dough tubes in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces, and roll into balls. </step>
    <step num="1">Place the pizza dough balls in a large bowl, then add the olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Toss gently with your hands to coat. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the mozzarella and onion and toss gently with your hands until evenly distributed. </step>
    <step num="3">Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). </step>
    <step num="4">In a medium bowl, combine the chicken and ¼ cup (65 g) of barbecue sauce. Add to the bowl with the dough balls and toss gently with your hands to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="5">Fill the bottom of a 9-inch (22 cm) cake pan with dough balls, make sure not to pack them too tightly. Spray the outside of a small oven-safe bowl with nonstick spray and place on top of the dough balls in the middle of the pan. Fill the area around the bowl with the remaining dough balls. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 25 minutes, or until the tops of the dough balls begin to turn light brown. </step>
    <step num="7">Remove from the oven. Use tongs to remove the small bowl and bake for another 10 minutes, or until the tops of the dough balls are golden brown and bubbling. </step>
    <step num="8">Fill the bowl indent with the remaining cup of barbecue sauce and sprinkle with cilantro. </step>
