  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Prepare the brownie mix as directed for “fudgy” brownies. Replace the directed amount of water with dark, freshly brewed, coffee. </step>
    <step num="2">Take 1 cup (235 ml) of the batter and transfer it to a 9 x 9in (23 x 23 cm) brownie tray that has been lined with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="3">Using a spatula, spread the batter evenly over the bottom of the pan to make a thin layer. </step>
    <step num="4">Once the batter is spread out, take another piece of parchment paper and layer it on top of the batter. Using your hands, smooth out the brownie mix to create a flat, even layer in the pan with no air bubbles between the batter and the paper. </step>
    <step num="5">Repeat steps 3 and 4 so that you have 2 thin brownie layers. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 14 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Once baked, remove the top layer of parchment paper form the brownie. Then remove the thin brownie form one pan and transfer it to a cooling rack. </step>
    <step num="8">NOTE: You will have one on the cooling rack and another still in the baking tray with the top layer of parchment paper removed. </step>
    <step num="9">Take the ice cream out of the freezer and give it 5-10 minutes to soften. </step>
    <step num="10">Once soft, spread the ice cream over the top of the brownie in the baking tray. </step>
    <step num="11">Use a spatula to even out the layer of ice cream before taking the first brownie layer from the cooling rack and placing it on top. </step>
    <step num="12">Lightly press the top brownie down into the ice cream then transfer the entire baking tray to the freezer to freeze completely. </step>
    <step num="13">Once frozen, use the remaining layer of parchment paper to lift the contents out of the baking tray and transfer them to a cutting board. </step>
    <step num="14">Quickly trim away the excess ice cream. </step>
    <step num="15">Cut the large layered brownie square into 8 2x4-inch (5x10-cm) sandwiches. </step>
    <step num="16">Either serve immediately or wrap the sandwiches in foil and transfer them back to the freezer for a later time. </step>
    <step num="17">Enjoy! </step>
