  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a liquid measuring cup, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water. Set aside for 5 minutes to bloom. </step>
    <step num="1">In a bowl, add 3 cups (375 g) of the flour, Parmesan, baking powder, salt, and sugar, and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and stir to combine. Pour the yeast water over the flour mixture and stir until the dough forms into a ball. </step>
    <step num="3">Use remaining flour for dusting the surface. Scrape the dough out of the bowl onto your floured surface. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until the dough is tight and form the dough into a ball. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour 1 tablespoon olive oil in a bowl. Place the dough in the bowl. </step>
    <step num="5">Cover, let rise for 1 hour in a warm area, or until the dough has doubled in size. </step>
    <step num="6">Flour the surface. Flip bowl over surface and let the dough fall out of the bowl. Cut the dough into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. Roll into balls. </step>
    <step num="7">Begin forming the dough into a circle about ½-inch (1 ¼-cm) thick and 5 inches(12-cm) wide, making sure the middle of the circle is not too thin. Repeat with the other balls of dough. </step>
    <step num="8">Spoon 1 tablespoon of tomato sauce on to the center of the dough. </step>
    <step num="9">Sprinkle 2 tablespoons mozzarella, then 1 tablespoon basil. Season with salt. </step>
    <step num="10">Fold the dough over the fillings and seal. Pinch the edge of the dough together and fold back. Repeat with the rest of the dough. </step>
    <step num="11">Heat 2 inches (5 cm) of oil until the temperature reaches 365˚F (185˚C). </step>
    <step num="12">Fry the calzones 2 at a time for about 3 minutes on each side. Remove from oil and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. </step>
    <step num="13">Place a bowl filled with the rest of the tomato sauce on the plate. </step>
    <step num="14">Sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
