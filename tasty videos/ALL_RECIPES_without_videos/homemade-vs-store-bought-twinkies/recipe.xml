  <steps>
    <step num="0">Using a hand mixer, beat the egg whites in a large bowl until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and continue beating until soft peaks form. </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks with a hand mixer. Add the sugar a bit at a time and beat until thickened. Add the yolk mixture to the egg whites. </step>
    <step num="2">Sift the cake flour, all-purpose flour, salt, and baking powder and add to the egg whites. Gently fold until fully combined. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the butter and milk to a bowl or glass measuring cup and microwave for 20 seconds, or until the butter melts completely. Add the butter mixture and the vanilla to the batter and gently mix. </step>
    <step num="4">If you have the Twinkie machine, you can simply pour in the batter and follow the machine’s instructions. </step>
    <step num="5">If you’re not using the Twinkie machine to bake your Twinkies, preheat the oven at 350ºF (180ºC). </step>
    <step num="6">If you are using DIY molds, grab a sheet of tin foil, fold it in half, then in half again, and, using a small container or other Twinkie-shaped item, mold the foil into an oblong shape. Trim the excess foil around the edges. Repeat to make 8-10 molds total. </step>
    <step num="7">Fill the molds halfways and bake for 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean. </step>
    <step num="8">If you are using a Twinkie baking pan, fill each indent halfway and bake for about 13 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of a cake comes out clean. Let the cakes cool down. </step>
    <step num="9">To make the filling, mix the marshmallow fluff and milk in a large bowl. Microwave for 20 seconds, then set aside to cool. </step>
    <step num="10">Once the cakes are done, let cool. Fill a pastry bag with the filling. Use the tip to make 3 small holes in each cake, and squeeze in the filling. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
