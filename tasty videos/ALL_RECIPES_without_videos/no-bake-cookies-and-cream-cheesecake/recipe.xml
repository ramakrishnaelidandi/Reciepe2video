  <steps>
    <step num="0">Separate the cream from the cookies into 2 different bowls. </step>
    <step num="1">Place the cookies into a plastic bag and crush them into fine crumbs with a rolling pin. Set aside ½ cup (50g) of the crumbs for later. </step>
    <step num="2">Pour the cookie crumbs into a bowl and combine with the melted butter, mixing until the texture is like slightly wet sand. </step>
    <step num="3">Press the cookie crumbs in an even layer into the bottom of a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">In a medium pot over low heat, mix together the cream cheese, sugar, the cream from the cookies, and vanilla extract, stirring until there are no lumps. </step>
    <step num="5">In a measuring cup, mix the milk with the gelatin until dissolved. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour the milk into the cream cheese mixture, stirring constantly until the mixture starts to bubble slightly. Remove from heat. </step>
    <step num="7">Pour the mixture over the cookie crust in the springform pan. Using a spatula or a spoon, smooth the top. </step>
    <step num="8">Sift the saved cookie crumbs on top of the cheesecake in an even layer, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours. </step>
    <step num="9">Unclasp the ring of the springform pan, slice, then serve! </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
