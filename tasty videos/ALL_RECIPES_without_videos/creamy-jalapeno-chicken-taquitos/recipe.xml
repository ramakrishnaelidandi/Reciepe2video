  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a sauce pan, over medium-high heat, combine all taquito filling ingredients. Mix well and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. </step>
    <step num="1">Wrap tortillas in a damp towel and microwave for 15-20 seconds. </step>
    <step num="2">Place about 2 tablespoons of filling across the tortilla about ⅓ of the way up from the bottom of the tortilla, and roll the tortilla around the filling. </step>
    <step num="3">Heat about ¼ inch (½ cm) of oil over medium-high heat. Carefully, place 3-4 taquitos in the oil, and cook for 3 minutes on each side. (Frying them seam side down first helps them stay closed during frying!) </step>
    <step num="4">Remove from the pan and drain excess oil on the taquito on a paper towel. </step>
    <step num="5">Place cooked taquitos on a bed of lettuce and garnish with crema, cilantro, cotija, and avocado. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
