    <step num="0">Mash bananas in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in eggs until well combined, then mix in remaining ingredients. </step>
    <step num="1">Heat a skillet to medium and add in a scoop of the pancake batter. Smooth out to form an even layer. Cook for about 2-3 minutes until you start to see bubbles releasing from the top of the batter. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 1-2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Garnish your pancakes with your favorite toppings! We used fresh strawberries and maple syrup. </step>
