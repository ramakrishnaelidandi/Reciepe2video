  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a medium skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and 1 teaspoon minced garlic, and sauté until soft, but not brown. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the rice and sauté until well-coated with the oil. Deglaze the pan with the wine and reduce until the pan is almost dry. </step>
    <step num="2">Using a 4-ounce (115 g) ladle, add one ladle of boiling stock to the rice. Stir the rice until the stock is absorbed and the rice is almost dry. Continue adding stock 1 ladle at a time until the rice is tender, but still firm. It should be moist and creamy, but not runny. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the tomato basil bisque and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="4">Remove the risotto from the heat, and stir in the butter and the Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="5">Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining teaspoon of minced garlic and the shrimp. Season with salt and white pepper. Add the peas and cook until the shrimp is pink and opaque, 4-5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove the shrimp from the heat and sprinkle with parsley. Divide the risotto between 2 warm serving plates. Top each with half the shrimp and peas. Serve immediately. </step>
