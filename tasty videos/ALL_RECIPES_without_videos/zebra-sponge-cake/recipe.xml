  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a bowl sift the flour cornstarch, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">In another bowl, add the butter, milk, and vanilla. Whisk until well-combined. Cover with a kitchen towel and set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">In two large bowls, separate 3 eggs into yolks and whites. Crack the last 2 whole eggs in the bowl with the egg yolks. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour 6 tablespoons of sugar into the egg yolk bowl. Mix on high until the batter is thick and pale yellow, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Beat the egg whites on high until frothy, then gradually add the 6 tablespoons of sugar. Continue beating until soft peaks form. </step>
    <step num="6">Gently fold in the egg yolk mixture into the egg whites. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the flour mixture, continue folding until the flour is mixed in. Create a well in the bowl, pour in the butter mixture. Fold all of the ingredients until the batter is smooth and silky. </step>
    <step num="8">Pour half of the batter into a smaller bowl. Sift the cocoa powder over the batter. Fold in until the cocoa powder is fully incorporated. </step>
    <step num="9">In a greased parchment paper-lined 8-inch (20 cm) cake pan, spoon in a scoop of the vanilla batter in the center of the pan. </step>
    <step num="10">Spoon in a scoop of the chocolate batter over the vanilla in the center. </step>
    <step num="11">Repeat until you have poured about 6 to 8 layers, keeping in mind you will be spooning in a little less batter each layer. </step>
    <step num="12">Using a chopstick or skewer, gently draw a line from the edge of the pan to the center. Repeat until you have made 8 lines. Pour a little chocolate dot in the center. </step>
    <step num="13">Bake for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. </step>
    <step num="14">Use a knife or spatula to gently release the cake from the edge of the pan. Cover the cake with a greased plate. Flip the cake on to the plate then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Let cool for about 20 minutes before slicing. </step>
    <step num="15">For the strawberry sauce, heat a saucepan over medium heat. Add the strawberries and sugar, and stir until bubbling. Remove from heat. </step>
    <step num="16">Serve with strawberry sauce and whipped cream! </step>
    <step num="17">Enjoy! </step>
