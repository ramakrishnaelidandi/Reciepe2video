    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="1">On a parchment-lined baking sheet, season both sides of the chicken with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and oregano. </step>
    <step num="2">Bake for 30 minutes, or until cooked through and juices run clear. </step>
    <step num="3">While the chicken is in the oven, combine the balsamic vinegar and honey in a sauce pot and simmer, stirring occasionally. </step>
    <step num="4">NOTE: It should take about 20 minutes for the mixture to reduce. </step>
    <step num="5">Once the glaze has reached your desired thickness, remove it from the heat and set aside. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove the chicken from the oven and top with slices of mozzarella and tomato. </step>
    <step num="7">Broil for 8-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melty and the tomatoes are slightly charred. </step>
    <step num="8">While the chicken is broiling, you can chiffonade (cut into thin strips) the basil. </step>
    <step num="9">Drizzle the balsamic glaze over the chicken and top with basil. </step>
