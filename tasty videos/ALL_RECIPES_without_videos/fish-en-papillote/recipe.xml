  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 200˚C (400˚F) </step>
    <step num="1">Add all the rice ingredients in a small saucepan. </step>
    <step num="2">Bring to a boil, then turn down to a very low simmer before covering with a tight-fitting lid. </step>
    <step num="3">Cook for 15 minutes. While the rice is simmering, prepare the fish. </step>
    <step num="4">Take 2 large sheets of baking paper, about 20-30 cm (8-12 inches). Fold in half and cut out a heart shape. </step>
    <step num="5">Place a piece of fish on the 1 side of the heart, top with half of the coriander stalks and half of the red onions. </step>
    <step num="6">Fold the paper in half and double fold all round to seal in the fish, a bit like a pasty. </step>
    <step num="7">Place on a baking tray and bake in the oven for 8 minutes. Once the fish is in the oven remove the rice from the heat and set aside for 5 minutes more. This will further steam the rice, making it soft and sticky. </step>
    <step num="8">Meanwhile prepare the dressing. Combine all the ingredients for the dressing, mix well. </step>
    <step num="9">Serve with salads or seasonal vegetables. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
