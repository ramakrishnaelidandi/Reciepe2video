  <steps>
    <step num="0">Cut the top off each jalapeño and core it, scraping out all the seeds, with the back side of a spoon. </step>
    <step num="1">Fill the jalapeños with pepper jack cheese, either melted or cubed. </step>
    <step num="2">Place the top back on the jalapeños and secure with two toothpicks inserted diagonally. </step>
    <step num="3">NOTE: Be sure each toothpick goes through both the top and the bottom of the jalapeño to secure it. </step>
    <step num="4">Dredge in flour, eggs, then breadcrumbs. For a thicker breading, double bread the jalapeños by repeating the egg and breadcrumb dredging. </step>
    <step num="5">Heat oil to 325°F (160°C). </step>
    <step num="6">Fry each jalapeño popper until golden brown (about 2-3 minutes). </step>
    <step num="7">Cool and allow extra oil to drip off on a plate lined with paper towels. Remove the toothpicks. </step>
    <step num="8">Season with salt and serve immediately once cooled enough to handle. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
