  <steps>
    <step num="0">Sprinkle gelatin over the water. The gelatin will absorb the water and dissolve, in a process called “blooming.” </step>
    <step num="1">In a small saucepan, combine heavy cream with sugar and cook over medium until it’s at the scalding point, or just under a boil. </step>
    <step num="2">Once the cream has almost reached the boiling point, remove from heat and add vanilla extract and bloomed gelatin. Stir until fully dissolved. </step>
    <step num="3">Strain panna cotta mixture into desired serving tempered glasses. </step>
    <step num="4">Allow cream to come to room temperature before chilling in the fridge for 2-4 hours, or until the cream is firm in texture. </step>
    <step num="5">Top with berries and honey. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
