    <step num="2">Add eggs and heavy cream and whisk until well combined. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">Cut a rectangle along the top of the loaf of french bread and pull out the part you cut along with the soft inside of the loaf. Set the “bread boat” aside. </step>
    <step num="4">Tear apart the rectangle and soft inside of the bread that you removed into little bite-size pieces. </step>
    <step num="5">Gently, fold the bread pieces and blueberries into the egg mixture until all of the liquid is absorbed. </step>
    <step num="6">Place the “bread boat” on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and pour in the bread and egg mixture. </step>
