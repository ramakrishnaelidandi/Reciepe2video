    <step num="0">In a large bowl, add the melted butter, sugar, and eggs. Whisk to combine, then add the milk and whisk to incorporate. Sift in the flour and salt and whisk until smooth. </step>
    <step num="1">Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Scoop ¼ cup (60 g) of the batter into the pan. Swirl the pan around until the batter evenly coats the bottom. Cook until the surface begins to bubble slightly and the edges brown, about 3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Flip the crepe and cook on the other side for another 1-2 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside to cool. Repeat with the remaining batter. </step>
    <step num="3">Spread whipped cream over 1 crepe and top with sliced strawberries in a pattern of your choice. </step>
    <step num="4">Fold another crepe in half and cut out a half-heart shape on the folded edge. Unfold the crepe and place over the first crepe. Repeat with the rest of the crepes. </step>
    <step num="5">Enjoy! </step>
