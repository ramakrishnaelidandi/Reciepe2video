  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Using a knife, separate the cream from the cookies, and place them in two separate bowls. </step>
    <step num="2">Crush cookies in a blender or a food processor until fine. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">In a pot over low heat, combine egg yolks, half &amp; half, sugar, and cornstarch. Turn the heat up to medium-high, whisking constantly to prevent any lumps. </step>
    <step num="4">Once the mixture starts to thicken, add in half of the cookie cream, stirring until smooth. </step>
    <step num="5">Transfer the cream mixture into a bowl, covering the top with plastic wrap and pressing the wrap down onto the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Chill. </step>
    <step num="6">In a pot, combine the water and butter, bringing it to a boil. Add the flour and ½ cup (40 grams) of the crushed cookie mixture, stirring until the dough comes together in a ball. Remove from heat. </step>
    <step num="7">Add in the eggs one a time, stirring until the dough becomes a paste. </step>
    <step num="8">Transfer the dough into a piping bag with a large round tip. </step>
    <step num="9">On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, pipe 1-inch mounds. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake for 20-25 minutes until the pastry has risen considerably and the insides are dry. </step>
    <step num="11">Transfer the chilled pastry cream into a piping bag with a small tip. </step>
    <step num="12">Poke a hole in the center of the bottom of each cream puff and fill each puff with the pastry cream. </step>
    <step num="13">Microwave the remaining cookie cream for 30 seconds, stirring until smooth. </step>
    <step num="14">Dip the top of each filled cream puff into the cookie cream, dripping off any excess. </step>
    <step num="15">Sprinkle any remaining cookies crumbs on top of each cream puff. </step>
    <step num="16">Enjoy! </step>
