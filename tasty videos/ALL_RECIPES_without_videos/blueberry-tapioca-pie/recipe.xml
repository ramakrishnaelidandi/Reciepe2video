  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium bowl, combine 6 tablespoons of sugar, the flour, and tapioca granules. </step>
    <step num="2">Sprinkle the sugar mixture over the blueberries in a large bowl. Add the lemon juice and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="3">Line an 8-inch (20-cm) metal pie tin with 1 of the pie crusts. </step>
    <step num="4">Spoon the blueberry mixture into the crust. Place the other crust on top. Press the edges of the crusts together with a fork and trim any excess dough around the sides with scissors. </step>
    <step num="5">Brush the milk over the top crust and sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of sugar. Cut a few slits in the top to release steam as the pie bakes. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake the pie for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350˚F (180˚C) and bake for 30-35 minutes more, until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. </step>
    <step num="7">Cool the pie on a wire rack for at least 2 hours to let the filling set. </step>
    <step num="8">Slice and serve with ice cream. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
