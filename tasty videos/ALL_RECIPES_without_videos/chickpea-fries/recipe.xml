  <steps>
    <step num="0">Bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Gradually whisk in 2 cups of chickpea flour. Continue to whisk until the mixture is thickened to the consistency of thick oatmeal. </step>
    <step num="1">Immediately transfer to a greased, baking dish. [We used an 8x10 (20x25 cm), but a larger one will just produce thinner fries]. Knock the dish on your work surface a few times to ensure that the mixture spreads evenly and to release any air bubbles. </step>
    <step num="2">Press plastic wrap over the mixture to ensure a flat surface and refrigerate for 2 hours until it has set firm. </step>
    <step num="3">Dipping sauce: In a medium bowl, combine greek yogurt, a pinch of salt, finely chopped parsley, finely chopped dill, clove garlic minced, and lemon juice. </step>
    <step num="4">Invert the baking dish on a cutting board (you may have to pull at the edges to release the suction for it to fall out cleanly). Slice into streak fry sizes. </step>
    <step num="5">Shallow fry in oil until each side is golden and crispy. Salt immediately after coming out of oil. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
