  <steps>
    <step num="0">Bring a medium saucepan filled with water to a boil. Add the cashews and boil for 30 minutes, then drain. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the boiled cashews, yogurt, coconut oil, nutritional yeast, salt, and water to a blender. Blend until smooth. </step>
    <step num="2">Transfer the “brie” mixture to a large bowl, cover with a kitchen towel, and let sit at room temperature, or between 72º-90ºF (22˚-32˚C), for 12-16 hours. </step>
    <step num="3">Transfer the mixture to a large saucepan over medium-high heat and add tapioca flour and agar agar flakes. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture is thick and pulls away from the sides of the pan, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Line an 8-inch (20-cm) round baking dish with cheesecloth and pour in the hot cheese mixture. Cover with the cheesecloth. Let cool in the refrigerator until firm, 4-8 hours. </step>
    <step num="5">Remove the cheesecloth. Eat right away or place the cheese on a wire rack and refrigerate for up to 36 hours (cheese will become drier the longer it waits). </step>
    <step num="6">Store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
