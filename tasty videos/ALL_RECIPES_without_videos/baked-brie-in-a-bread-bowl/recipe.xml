  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Cut off the top of the bread boule so the top surface is flat and without crust. Slice the crusty top into sticks and set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Set the brie wheel on top of the bread and cut out a hole for the brie. Set the brie aside and remove the cut out bread. </step>
    <step num="3">In a small bowl, mix the olive oil with 2 cloves of garlic and brush over the bread. Set the boule aside. </step>
    <step num="4">Carefully cut the top rind off of the brie wheel. Place the brie, cut-side up, inside the bread and set it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="5">Scoop out about a tablespoon of the center of the brie and pour the white wine into the divot. </step>
    <step num="6">Top the brie with the remaining minced garlic and chopped bacon, and season with pepper. Arrange the bread sticks next to the bread on the baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 15- 20 minutes, until the brie is completely melted. </step>
    <step num="8">Sprinkle with chives. </step>
    <step num="9">Dip the bread sticks and any other dipping items you’d like in the brie. </step>
    <step num="10">To reheat, bake the brie at 250°F (120°C) for about 15 minutes, until melted. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
