  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, combine flour, eggs, butter, and sugar, stirring until ingredients are slightly mixed. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the milk ½ cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring vigorously, making sure the milk is completely incorporated into the batter and that the batter is smooth before adding more milk. </step>
    <step num="2">Repeat with the rest of the milk. The batter should be very liquidy and have no lumps. </step>
    <step num="3">In a pan over medium heat, pour ⅓ cup (95 g) of the batter in the center and swirl the batter around the edges of the pan until set. </step>
    <step num="4">To know when the crepe is ready to flip, lift up one of the edges about ⅓ of the way. The bottom side should be golden brown. Flip the crepe. </step>
    <step num="5">Cook until the edges are starting to slightly crisp. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove from heat and cover with a paper towel to make sure the crepes stay moist. </step>
    <step num="7">Add graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows to crepe. Fold crepe over twice. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake at 350˚F (175˚C) for 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Remove from heat and cool. </step>
    <step num="10">Serve with chocolate syrup and crumbled graham crackers. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
