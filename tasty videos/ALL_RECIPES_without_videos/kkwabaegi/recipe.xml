  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, whisk together the warm milk, butter, and sugar. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the yeast and let the mixture sit for 10 minutes, until it becomes foamy. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the salt and egg and whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the flour. Mix with a spatula until the dough starts to come together. </step>
    <step num="4">Knead the dough on a floured surface for 3-5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Drizzle a bit of oil into the bowl, then add the dough. Cover with a cloth or plastic wrap and let rest in warm place for 1 hour, or until the dough doubles in size. </step>
    <step num="6">Sprinkle the dough with a bit of flour, then punch down to release the gas and knead it for a few minutes until the dough is soft and smooth. Cover again and let it sit for another 30 minutes, or doubled in size again. </step>
    <step num="7">Heat oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat until it reaches to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="8">Transfer the dough to a clean surface, sprinkle with a bit of flour, and knead for 3-5 minutes, or until you have a soft, shiny, slightly sticky dough. </step>
    <step num="9">Divide the dough into 12 equal parts and roll into balls. Set the balls on a plate and cover with plastic wrap. </step>
    <step num="10">Working one at a time, roll a ball of dough out on your cutting board so it forms a rope 10-inches (25 cm) long and ½-inch (1 cm) in diameter. </step>
    <step num="11">Place a hand on either end of the dough rope. Move one hand upward and the other downward so that the rope becomes twisted in between your hands as you roll it. </step>
    <step num="12">Lift the dough, joining the 2 ends together to seal. The tension in the dough will twist it as it hangs. Add more twists, if desired. </step>
    <step num="13">Repeat with the remaining dough pieces. </step>
    <step num="14">Allow the doughnuts to rise for 30 minutes on a tray or cutting board, flipping halfway. </step>
    <step num="15">Reduce the heat under the skillet to medium. </step>
    <step num="16">Gently lower each doughnut into the hot oil. </step>
    <step num="17">Fry for 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Occasionally flip doughnuts over to ensure they are even in color. Drain on a wire rack. </step>
    <step num="18">In a small bowl, mix together 1 cup (200 g) of sugar and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon. </step>
    <step num="19">Distribute mixture onto a plate, and roll the doughnuts in the cinnamon sugar. </step>
    <step num="20">Serve warm. </step>
    <step num="21">Enjoy! </step>
