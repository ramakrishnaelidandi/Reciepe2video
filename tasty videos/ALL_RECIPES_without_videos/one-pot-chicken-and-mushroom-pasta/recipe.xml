  <steps>
    <step num="0">Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot on medium heat. Add chicken, salt and pepper, and brown - make sure to cook through. Set chicken aside. </step>
    <step num="1">Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the onion into the pot and stir. Cook down for 1-2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Add mushrooms and garlic, and stir to incorporate with the onion. Season with salt and pepper to taste as well as thyme and paprika. Stir to evenly season. </step>
    <step num="3">Add chicken broth and heavy cream to the pot and stir. Bring to a boil, then add the farfalle pasta. </step>
    <step num="4">Cook according to package instructions, being sure to stir every 1-2 minutes to keep the pasta from clumping together. (Cook time may be a little longer in this recipe than when the pasta is boiled in water.) </step>
    <step num="5">When the farfalle pasta is al dente, add the spinach and chicken and stir until the spinach cooks down and incorporates. </step>
    <step num="6">Add parmesan and stir until it’s well-incorporated and you’re left with a smooth sauce. </step>
    <step num="7">Top off with extra parmesan and serve. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
