    <step num="5">Roll out the dough into an oval shape and spread butter on one side of the dough. Then, dust with cinnamon, brown sugar, and rainbow sprinkles. </step>
    <step num="6">Starting at the bottom of the widest end, roll dough and cut into 1½- to 2-inch pieces and place in a baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap, and rest for 30 minutes. Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. </step>
