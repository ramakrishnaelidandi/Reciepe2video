  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large pot of salted boiling water, blanch the green beans for 3 minutes, until tender and bright green. Drain and transfer to a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking dish. </step>
    <step num="2">Melt 4 tablespoons of butter in a large pan over high heat. Add the onions and cook for 8 minutes, until softened and translucent. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes, until browned. Add the garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the vegetable mixture to the casserole dish with the green beans. Wipe out the pan. </step>
    <step num="5">Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter in the same pan. Add the flour and stir to combine. Cook until a golden brown roux forms, for 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the milk, heavy cream, salt, pepper, chicken broth, and Parmesan cheese, and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the sauce is thickened, about 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Pour the sauce evenly over the vegetables in the casserole dish and toss until everything is well coated. Cover with foil. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 10 minutes. </step>
