  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a baking dish with the steak, mix the soy sauce, garlic, ginger, honey, lime juice, and Sriracha sauce (optional). </step>
    <step num="1">Lightly massage the marinade into the steak and cover. Refrigerate 1-4 hours. </step>
    <step num="2">Place toothpicks in a bowl and pour water over toothpicks until completely submerged. Water will prevent toothpicks from burning. </step>
    <step num="3">Once marinated, cut the steak into 8 equal rectangles. You may need to pound the steak thinner if using a thicker cut. </step>
    <step num="4">Place a few slices of each of the vegetables on a slice of steak, making sure they are all about the same length. </step>
    <step num="5">Roll the steak up over the vegetables and secure it with a toothpick. </step>
    <step num="6">In a small saucepan over medium heat, pour in the leftover marinade and bring to a boil. </step>
    <step num="7">Boil for about one minute, take off the heat, and set aside to use as a glaze. </step>
    <step num="8">In a grill pan or on the grill over medium high heat, place your steak roll-ups and cook for 2-3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Flip the roll over and use a heat-safe brush to brush the glaze on each roll. </step>
    <step num="10">Cook for about one minute longer and remove from heat. Top with sesame seeds. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
