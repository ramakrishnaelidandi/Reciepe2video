    <step num="0">Place the glass noodles in a large bowl and add enough hot water to cover. Let sit for 10 minutes, until softened. Drain the noodles and chop into ½-inch (1-cm) pieces. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, mix together the chopped glass noodles, cabbage, carrots, scallions, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Toss until well combined. </step>
    <step num="2">Place a spring roll wrapper on a clean work surface and add 3 tablespoons of filling to the center. Fold the bottom of the wrapper over the filling, then fold in the sides and roll. Lightly wet the exposed with your fingertip and continue rolling to seal the egg roll. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. </step>
    <step num="3">Fill a deep skillet with ½ inch (1 cm) of vegetable oil and heat over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 325˚F(160˚C). Fry the egg rolls in batches of 1-2 at a time for 2½- 3 minutes on each side, until crispy and golden brown. Remove from oil and drain on a wire rack or plate lined with paper towels to absorb any extra oil. </step>
    <step num="4">Enjoy! </step>
