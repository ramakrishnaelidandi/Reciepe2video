  <steps>
    <step num="0">Generously season the short ribs all over with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the dried shiitake mushrooms to a large heatproof bowl and pour in enough boiling water to cover. Cover with plastic wrap and let soak for 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="2">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="3">Heat the canola oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Working in 2 batches, sear the short ribs on all sides until deeply browned and crispy, about 10 minutes total. Remove the ribs from the pot and transfer to a plate. </step>
    <step num="4">To pan with excess oil and beef fat, add the onion, Asian pear, ginger, scallions, and garlic, then cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened and slightly browned, about 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the rice wine and stir to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the drained shiitake mushrooms, 1 cup (240 ml) of the shiitake soaking liquid, the sugar, light and dark soy sauces, gochujang, mirin, and sesame oil. Stir and bring to a boil. </step>
    <step num="7">Nestle the short ribs back into the sauce, cover, and braise in the oven for 3 hours, or until the short ribs are tender enough to fall off the bone. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve the short ribs over rice with the braising liquid spooned on top. Top with kimchi, sliced scallions, and toasted sesame seeds. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
