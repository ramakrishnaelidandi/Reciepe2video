  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 325ºF (170ºC). </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium bowl, cream the butter and slowly add the sugar. Beat until light and fluffy. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the eggs one at a time, mixing until incorporated. </step>
    <step num="3">Sift the flour and baking powder into the sugar mixture. Add salt and mix until just combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the vanilla, milk, and lemon juice, and mix until incorporated. </step>
    <step num="5">Scoop mixture into a lined cupcake tin about ¾ full. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake 12-15 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out cleanly from the center of the cupcakes. Let cupcakes cool. </step>
    <step num="7">Prepare the lemon curd by whisking the yolks and sugar in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water. </step>
    <step num="8">Once the sugar is dissolved, add the lemon juice and zest. Stir until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Once the curd coats the back of a spoon, add the butter and stir until melted. </step>
    <step num="10">Remove from the heat, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. Make sure the cling film touches the surface of the curd so that a film doesn’t form on top. </step>
    <step num="11">Prepare the frosting by whisking the egg whites and sugar in a heatproof bowl over simmering water until it thickens and the sugar dissolves completely. Tempering the eggs will ensure the frosting is food safe without being baked. </step>
    <step num="12">Remove from the heat, add the cream of tartar, and beat about 10 minutes until soft peaks form. </step>
    <step num="13">Using a piping tip or a knife, cut a hole into the top of the cupcakes and press down to make a well for the curd. </step>
    <step num="14">Add lemon curd into the cupcakes and frost them with the meringue. </step>
    <step num="15">Torch the frosting or carefully broil for about 3 to 4 minutes. Be sure that you use foil cupcake liners if broiling! </step>
    <step num="16">Enjoy! </step>
