  <steps>
    <step num="0">Prepare the crepe batter in 2 separate batches. In a very large bowl, whisk together 12 cups (1.5 kg) of flour, ½ cup (100 g) of sugar, and 2 teaspoons of salt. </step>
    <step num="1">Create a well in the center and add 24 eggs. Stir together vigorously with a large wooden spoon until combined. </step>
    <step num="2">Add 1 cup (240 ml) of milk and continue to stir vigorously until combined. </step>
    <step num="3">Add 1½ cups (345 g) of the melted butter. Stir until combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Gradually add 14 more cups (3.3 l) of milk to the batter, stirring well after each addition. Once the batter has loosened a bit, switch from the wooden spoon to a heavy duty whisk. Whisk vigorously to remove any clumps. </step>
    <step num="5">Once the milk is incorporated and there are no more lumps, whisk in 1 cup (240 ml) of water and 2 tablespoons of vanilla. </step>
    <step num="6">Place the batter in the fridge to rest for 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="7">Repeat steps 1-7 to prepare the second batch of batter. </step>
    <step num="8">Heat a large round electric griddle to 375˚F (190˚C). </step>
    <step num="9">Pour ½ cup (120 ml) of batter onto the heated griddle and swirl evenly to coat. Fill in any gaps with extra batter. </step>
    <step num="10">Cook for approximately 2 minutes, until the crepe begins to lightly brown on the bottom. </step>
    <step num="11">Flip the crepe and cook for another minute on the other side. Remove from the pan and set aside to cool. Repeat 99 more times. This will take approximately 5 hours. </step>
    <step num="12">Place the completed crepes in stacks of 10 and store, covered, in the fridge until ready to assemble the cake. </step>
    <step num="13">Make the vanilla pastry cream: In a large stock pot set over medium heat, add the egg yolks, milk, cream, sugar, salt, and cornstarch. Whisk vigorously to combine. </step>
    <step num="14">Whisk constantly until the mixture thickens significantly and bubbles just begin to burst on the surface. You do not want to let the mixture come to a full boil. This will take approximately 10-15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="15">Remove the pot from the heat and add the butter and vanilla. Stir until fully incorporated. </step>
    <step num="16">Repeat to make the other flavors of pastry cream. Mix in each flavoring while the cream is still warm, after incorporating the butter. </step>
    <step num="17">Pour the cream onto a baking sheet lined with plastic wrap. This will ensure the custard cools safely and quickly. Cover with more plastic wrap, ensuring the plastic touches the surface to prevent a skin from forming. </step>
    <step num="18">Immediately place in the fridge to cool and set, overnight. </step>
    <step num="19">To assemble the crepe cake, place 1 crepe on a large cutting board or baking sheet (you will need to be able to transfer the cake to and from the freezer). </step>
    <step num="20">Spread about ½ cup (110 g) of the cooled pastry cream (flavor of your choice) evenly over the crepe. </step>
    <step num="21">Place another crepe directly on top and spread with more pastry cream. Repeat until you have 25 crepes stacked with the first filling. </step>
    <step num="22">Transfer the assembled cake to the freezer to chill for 15 minutes between flavors. </step>
    <step num="23">Repeat with each flavor of pastry cream, layering 25 crepes with each flavor filling. Make sure to freeze the cake for 15 minutes after every 25 layers. </step>
    <step num="24">Once assembled, freeze the cake for 30 minutes to set and firm up. </step>
    <step num="25">Dust the top with powdered sugar, then slice and serve. Sticking a wooden dowel into each slice will help the cake keep its shape. </step>
    <step num="26">Enjoy! </step>
