  <steps>
    <step num="0">Coat a 10-inch (25 cm) frying pan with olive oil. Add minced garlic and chopped onion, stirring consistently until lightly browned. </step>
    <step num="1">Add ground beef, and stir to mix with onion and garlic. </step>
    <step num="2">Once beef has begun to brown and water has been released drain water and fat then continue cooking until beef begins to brown and become tender and crispy. </step>
    <step num="3">Add marinara sauce and mix together. Sprinkle salt and pepper to taste, remove heat. </step>
    <step num="4">Add mozzarella. Stir until mozzarella binds to mixture. </step>
    <step num="5">While mixture cools boil four cups of water in medium pot and add lasagna noodles, lay them in across each other in a star formation so they do not bind together, stir regularly. </step>
    <step num="6">After eight to 10 minutes drain pasta and allow to cool for five minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Cut noodles down to 3- to 4-inch (8-10cm) slices and place mixture inside and roll. </step>
    <step num="8">Place poppers in freezer for 12 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Dip poppers in egg wash, flour, and bread crumbs, then once more in the egg wash and bread crumbs. </step>
    <step num="10">Freeze for additional 12 minutes. </step>
    <step num="11">Heat 3–4 inches (8-10cm) of canola oil at medium heat in a pot for 15 minutes — test by splashing drops of water into oil (it should sizzle). </step>
    <step num="12">Place poppers in oil three or four at a time until they are golden brown on all sides, allow them to cool for 10–12 minutes and serve with marinara sauce as dip. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
