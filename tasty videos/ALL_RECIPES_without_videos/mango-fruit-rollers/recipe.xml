  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 75˚C (165˚F) (or as low as your oven will go!) </step>
    <step num="1">Chop the mango and squeeze into a glass. </step>
    <step num="2">Blend the mango flesh until it forms a thick paste, a few bits are totally acceptable. </step>
    <step num="3">Spread an even, thin layer of the fruit onto a baking tray lined with baking paper, smooth it out using a spatula or cake knife. </step>
    <step num="4">Bake in the centre of an oven for 3.5 hours. The mango should be a tiny bit springy but not too juicy or too dry, the edges will probably dry out more than the centre. </step>
    <step num="5">Take the baking paper out of the tray and cut off the super dry edges on each side. </step>
    <step num="6">Roll up the mango, including the baking paper and cut into segments about 1.5 inches (4 cm) apart. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
