  <steps>
    <step num="0">Beat the eggs with the salt until the whites and the yolks are completely combined, with no spots of egg white remaining. </step>
    <step num="1">Over medium-low heat, melt the butter in a skillet, then pour in the eggs. </step>
    <step num="2">Using a rubber spatula, constantly scrape the bottom of the pan while shaking the pan in a circular motion to ensure that the eggs cook slowly, forming only small curds, about 1-2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Once you start to see the bottom of the pan for more than a second after scraping, push the eggs into a round circular shape. Cook until the edges solidify, then tilt the pan and carefully roll the omelette on itself. </step>
    <step num="4">Invert onto a plate, then sprinkle with chives. </step>
    <step num="5">Serve immediately. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
