  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 300˚F (150˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a small bowl, combine 1 teaspoon of salt, the pepper, onion powder, paprika, garlic powder, chili powder, and cumin. </step>
    <step num="2">Slice the potatoes on a mandolin or with a sharp knife into ¹⁄₁₆-inch (1 mm) thick slices. </step>
    <step num="3">Transfer the potato slices to a large bowl and cover with water. Toss the potato slices around to remove excess starch, then drain the water. </step>
    <step num="4">Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons of salt onto the potato slices and toss, then drain any excess water. </step>
    <step num="5">Sprinkle half the spice mixture over the potatoes and toss until well-coated. </step>
    <step num="6">Invert a muffin tin and place the potato slices in between the muffin tin walls to create taco shapes. If you have one, use a second muffin tin for the remaining potato slices, or repeat when finished baking the first batch. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake the potato slices for 25 minutes, or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="8">Season the skirt steak with the remaining spice mix on both sides. </step>
    <step num="9">Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add the skirt steak and cook for 3 minutes on each side until it is seared with a golden brown crust. </step>
    <step num="10">Remove the steak from the pan and let rest on a cutting board for 10 minutes. Once rested, cut the steak into ½-inch (1 cm) cubes. </step>
    <step num="11">Sprinkle the cheese blend and steak into the potato taco shells. </step>
    <step num="12">Bake for another 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. </step>
    <step num="13">Serve with pico de gallo, guacamole, and sour cream. </step>
    <step num="14">Garnish with chopped chives, if desired. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
