  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a food processor, pulse the walnuts until mostly crumbly, about 10 pulses. Add the mushrooms and pulse again until crumbly, but do not to overprocess. </step>
    <step num="2">Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion and cook for 3-4 minutes, until semi-translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until fragrant. Add the mushroom walnut mixture and cook for 5-7 minutes, until most of the liquid from the mushrooms has been released and evaporated. Add the soy sauce, paprika, fennel, salt, and pepper and cook for 3-4 minutes more, until the mushroom mixture begins crisp slightly. Remove from the heat. </step>
    <step num="3">Use your hands to stretch the pizza dough into a circle about 14 inches (35 cm) in diameter and ½-inch (1 ¼ cm) thick. Lay on a sheet of parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="4">Spread the marinara sauce over the pizza dough in an even layer, then sprinkle with the vegan mozzarella. Top with the mushroom walnut mixture, olives, and bell pepper. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 14-16 minute, until the crust is lightly golden around the edges. </step>
    <step num="6">Cut into 8 slices and serve. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
