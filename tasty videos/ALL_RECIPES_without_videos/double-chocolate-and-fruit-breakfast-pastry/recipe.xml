  <steps>
    <step num="0">Roll out the sheet of puff pastry. Using a sharp knife, cut in half diagonally and then again horizontally to make 4 squares. Then cut each square diagonally to make 8 triangles. </step>
    <step num="1">Layer the triangles on a lined baking tray to make a star shape. In each triangle, spread on the chocolate spread (about ½ tablespoon per triangle will be enough). </step>
    <step num="2">Then, in the middle, scatter on the grated chocolate, banana, strawberries, and flaked almonds in a circle shape. </step>
    <step num="3">Fold over the triangles to meet in the middle. Glaze with some egg wash. </step>
    <step num="4">Bake in the oven at 180°C (350°F) for 25 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Cut out each triangle to make a serving. </step>
    <step num="6">Drizzle on some dark melted chocolate, icing sugar or with leftover strawberries and banana. Enjoy! </step>
