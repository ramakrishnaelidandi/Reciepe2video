    <step num="0">In a small bowl, mix together the ranch dressing mix, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="1">Melt the coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add 3-4 popcorn kernels and cover with the lid. Once they pop, add the rest of the kernels and cover, shaking every 10 seconds, until they begin pop. Once the pops are more than 3 seconds apart, turn off the heat and let sit for 15 seconds to allow any final kernels to pop. </step>
    <step num="2">Uncover and drizzle the olive oil over the popcorn. Carefully toss to coat. </step>
    <step num="3">Sprinkle the cool ranch spice mixture over the popcorn and stir to coat evenly. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer to a bowl and eat immediately, or spread in a single layer on a baking sheet and let cool completely before storing in a sealed container for up to 2 days. </step>
    <step num="5">Enjoy! </step>
