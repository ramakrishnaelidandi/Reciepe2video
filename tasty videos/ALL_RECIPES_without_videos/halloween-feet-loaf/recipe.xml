  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine the beef, salt, pepper, garlic powder, mustard powder, cayenne, minced onion, eggs, bread crumbs, milk, parsley, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well until evenly combined. </step>
    <step num="2">Split the meat mixture in half and place on the baking sheet. Shape each half into a “foot.” </step>
    <step num="3">Press up to form an ankle and hollow out the top to make room for “ankle bones.” Add the halved onion, cut side up, to each divot. Cut 5 toes on each foot and add the reserved slivers of onion to make “toenails.” </step>
    <step num="4">Brush around the ankles with ketchup to look like “blood.” </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 1 hour, until the meat is cooked through. </step>
    <step num="6">Serve warm. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
