  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC). </step>
    <step num="1">With a sharp knife, slice the squash in half. If the squash is too tough, puncture in several places forming a dotted line around the squash. Microwave for 3-5 minutes to soften. Allow to cool before cutting in half. </step>
    <step num="2">Scoop out the seeds, brush with oil, and sprinkle with salt, and pepper. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a fork can easily pierce the skin. </step>
    <step num="3">Meanwhile, in a blender combine basil, olive oil, vegetarian Parmesan cheese, garlic, pine nuts, and salt. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">In a pan add the olive oil and garlic over medium-high heat, sautè 30 seconds-1 minute, add in mushrooms and cook for 3 minutes. Add asparagus and stir until cooked. </step>
    <step num="5">Remove squash from the oven, with a fork pull at the edges to produce that stringy “spaghetti” quality until you’ve completed both of them. </step>
    <step num="6">In the mushroom and asparagus pan combine “spaghetti” and pesto and mix. Return to the squash and serve with or without plates. Garnish with parmesan. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
