    <step num="0">In a large bowl, combine the chicken thighs with the garlic powder, thyme, dried parsley, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Toss until well coated. </step>
    <step num="1">In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, cook the chicken until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board to cool for 5 minutes, then shred with 2 forks into small pieces. </step>
    <step num="2">To the same pot, add the butter, carrots, celery, onion, mushrooms, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook over medium heat until the veggies are soft, 5-10 minutes. Remove from the pot and set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the wild rice and 3½ cups of chicken broth to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes, or until the rice is tender. </step>
    <step num="4">Once the rice is cooked, stir in the Parmesan, cooked vegetables, heavy cream, and remaining 4½ cups of broth. Bring to a boil. Stir in the sour cream, fresh parsley, and shredded chicken. </step>
    <step num="5">Serve warm topped with more Parmesan. </step>
