    <step num="0">Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Add the salt. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 20 minutes longer. </step>
    <step num="1">Drain the potatoes and press through a potato ricer into a large bowl. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Heat the butter, cream, and milk in a small pot over low heat until simmering. </step>
    <step num="3">Pour the cream mixture over the potatoes and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="4">Garnish with chives, if desired. </step>
    <step num="5">Note: A potato ricer gives these potatoes a super fluffy texture, but you can use a hand masher if you don’t own one. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
