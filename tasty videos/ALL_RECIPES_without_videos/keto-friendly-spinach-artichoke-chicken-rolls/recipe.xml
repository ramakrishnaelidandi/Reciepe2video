  <steps>
    <step num="0">Add a tablespoon of olive oil to a skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add garlic and cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the spinach and artichoke, and stir. </step>
    <step num="2">Mix in cream cheese, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese, and stir until the cheeses are well incorporated. Remove from the heat and set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="4">Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder until evenly coated. </step>
    <step num="5">To pound out the chicken, take a chicken breast and butterfly it by slicing half way into it to open like a book, making sure not to slice all the way through. Cover the breast with parchment paper or plastic wrap. Gently pound the meat with a mallet or rolling pin until it is evenly flattened, about ¼ inch (6 mm) in thickness. </step>
    <step num="6">Onto each pounded chicken breast, evenly add ¼ of the spinach-artichoke mixture, but making sure to not overfill the chicken. </step>
    <step num="7">Carefully roll the chicken breast until the ends overlap and then place the chicken into a greased baking dish. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 20 minutes or until the chicken is fully opaque and reaches at least 165°F (75°C). </step>
    <step num="9">Serve with riced cauliflower, broccoli, or other low carb vegetables of your choice. </step>
    <step num="10">Eat right away or refrigerate until ready to eat. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
