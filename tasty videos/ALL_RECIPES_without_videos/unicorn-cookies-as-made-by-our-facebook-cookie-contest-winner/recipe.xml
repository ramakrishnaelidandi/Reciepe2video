  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl with an electric hand mixer or in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and corn syrup until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, then add the eggs and vanilla. Beat for 3 minutes, or until fully incorporated. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and mix just until the dough comes together. Do not overmix. </step>
    <step num="3">Scrape down the sides of the bowl again, then fold in the white chocolate chips, sprinkles, oats, rice cereal, and fruit-shaped cereal. </step>
    <step num="4">Using an ice cream scoop or ¼ measuring cup (60 grams), scoop the dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to a 1 week. </step>
    <step num="5">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="6">Arrange the chilled dough balls 4 inches (10 cm) apart on the prepared baking sheets. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 6 minutes, then remove the cookies from the oven and place a corn chip in the center of each cookie to resemble a unicorn horn. Return to the oven for 6-8 minutes more, until lightly browned around the edges. </step>
    <step num="8">Let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheets before serving. The cookies will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 1 month. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
