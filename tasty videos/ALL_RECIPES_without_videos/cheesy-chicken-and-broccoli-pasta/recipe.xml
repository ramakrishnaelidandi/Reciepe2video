    <step num="0">Heat olive oil on medium heat in a large pot. Add chicken breasts, season with salt and pepper, and allow the chicken to brown on one side. </step>
    <step num="1">Flip chicken, then add onions and garlic as the second side browns. </step>
    <step num="2">Once the chicken has browned on both sides, add chicken broth, water, and pasta to the pot. </step>
    <step num="3">Stir all ingredients, cover the pot with a lid, and bring to a boil. When it begins to boil, uncover and stir. Bring the heat to low, stir, then cover and let simmer for 20 minutes. </step>
