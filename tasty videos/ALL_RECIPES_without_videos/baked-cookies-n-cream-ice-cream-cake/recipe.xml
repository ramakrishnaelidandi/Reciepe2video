  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Grease 2 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pans with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine the melted ice cream, cake mix, and egg whites. Whisk until smooth. </step>
    <step num="2">Divide the cake batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake according to the package instructions, about 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Place 1 cake on a cake stand or platter. Spread an even layer of frosting over the cake. Sprinkle 6 of the crushed chocolate sandwich cookies evenly over the frosting. Top with the other cake layer. Spread a thin layer of frosting over the top and sides of the cake. </step>
    <step num="4">Chill the cake in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Coat the top and sides of the cake with frosting. Transfer the remaining frosting to a piping bag or resealable plastic bag fitted with a medium star tip.
