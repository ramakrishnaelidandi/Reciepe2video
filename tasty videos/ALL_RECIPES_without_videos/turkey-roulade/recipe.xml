  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Melt the butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery, and cook for 8-10 minutes, until the vegetables have softened. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the sausage and cook until browned, about 8-10 minutes, breaking the meat up into smaller pieces. Season with the sage and thyme. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the stuffing mix and chicken stock. Stir until the bread is no longer dry. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. </step>
    <step num="4">Place the turkey breast on a cutting board, skin-side down. Cover with plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet to about ½-inch (1 cm) thick. </step>
    <step num="5">Brush the turkey breast with the Dijon mustard. </step>
    <step num="6">Spread the stuffing mixture over the turkey breast in an even layer, about ¼-inch (6 mm) thick. Transfer any extra stuffing to an oven-safe dish. </step>
    <step num="7">Starting from a short end, roll the turkey into a log with the skin on the outside. Tuck in any loose bits. </step>
    <step num="8">Use kitchen twine to tie the turkey closed crosswise at 1-inch (2-cm) intervals. Tie once lengthwise to seal the ends. </step>
    <step num="9">Transfer the trussed turkey to a wire rack set over a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush with melted butter and season all sides generously with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake the turkey roulade for 45-60 minutes, until the internal temperature of the turkey reaches 165°F (75˚C). Bake the leftover stuffing for 20-30 minutes, until lightly browned on top. </step>
    <step num="11">Let rest for 15 minutes, then remove the twine, slice, and serve. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
