    <step num="1">In a large bowl, mix the self-rising flour and greek yogurt until it comes together to form a ball. </step>
    <step num="2">Transfer the dough ball to a lightly floured work surface and use your hands to begin flattening and shaping the rough into a roughly 8-inch (20 cm) disk. </step>
    <step num="3">Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the dough into 8 equal pieces. </step>
    <step num="4">One at a time, roll each piece out into a roughly 12 inch (30 cm) log and set aside. </step>
    <step num="5">Transfer the dough logs to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and shape individual knots. Repeat with remaining logs. </step>
    <step num="6">In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, garlic, parsley, and salt. </step>
    <step num="7">Brush each knot with garlic oil mixture. </step>
