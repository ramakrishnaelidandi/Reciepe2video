  <steps>
    <step num="0">Remove any giblets etc. from the cavity of the chicken, sometimes in a small bag. </step>
    <step num="1">Stuff chicken with 1 sprig of rosemary, 1 lemon (quartered) and 4 cloves garlic. </step>
    <step num="2">Season all sides of the chicken with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="3">Remove both ends of a lemon, cut in half to create very thick slices. </step>
    <step num="4">Line the bottom of the slow cooker with 4 lemon slices, 4 whole garlic cloves and a sprig of rosemary. </step>
    <step num="5">Put the chicken in the slow cooker. </step>
    <step num="6">Cut 2 garlic cloves in half and put all four pieces on top of the chicken along with the 2 remaining lemon slices. </step>
    <step num="7">Garnish with 1-2 more sprigs of rosemary. Put the lid on the slow cooker and set to high for 4 hours. </step>
    <step num="8">Place cooked chicken under the grill (broil) for 10 minutes to crisp the skin (optional). </step>
    <step num="9">Allow chicken to rest for 10 minutes before carving and serving. Leftover juices in the slow cooker are mostly lemon juice with a bit of chicken fat and can be used sparingly as a strongly flavoured sauce. </step>
