  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and coconut oil until combined. </step>
    <step num="1">Whisk in the oat milk and vanilla, until the sugar has dissolved and the batter is smooth. </step>
    <step num="2">Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula, being careful not to overmix, until just combined. </step>
    <step num="3">Fold in the chocolate chips. </step>
    <step num="4">Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="6">Using an ice cream scoop, scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving at least 2 inches (5 cm) of space between each cookie and the edges of the pan so the cookies can spread evenly. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until cookies just begin to brown. </step>
    <step num="8">Let the cookies cool completely. </step>
    <step num="9">Use a serrated knife to slice the pint of ice cream pint into 1½-inch (4-cm) thick discs. Peel off the paper container from each ice cream slice. </step>
    <step num="10">Take 2 cooled cookies and sandwich an ice cream slice in between, pressing firmly. </step>
    <step num="11">Roll the edges of the ice cream sandwich in the chocolate chunks, if desired. Repeat with the remaining cookies and ice cream. </step>
    <step num="12">Eat right away, or place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and freeze for 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="13">The sandwiches will keep in the freezer for up to 6 months in an airtight container. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
