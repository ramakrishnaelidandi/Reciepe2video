  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Grease a 9x13-inch (23x33cm) baking dish with nonstick spray. Pour the white cake batter into the baking dish. </step>
    <step num="2">Bake for 25 minutes, or until the center is cooked through. </step>
    <step num="3">In a medium bowl, whisk together the peaches, condensed milk, and heavy cream. Use the whisk to break up the peaches. </step>
    <step num="4">Remove cake from oven and let cool for 30 minutes or until room temperature. </step>
    <step num="5">Once the cake is cool, use the rounded end of a wooden spoon to poke 6 rows of 5 holes in the cake. Tip: Clean off the end of the wooden spoon after every other hole to prevent making cracks in the cake. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour the peach mixture over the cake and use a spatula to spread it, filling all of the holes. Some of the mixture will stay on top of the cake. Chill in the fridge for 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="7">Remove the cake from the fridge and use a spatula to cover the cake in whipped cream. Then, arrange the peach slices on top in 5 rows of 11 slices. </step>
    <step num="8">Pairs well with Chardonnay. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
