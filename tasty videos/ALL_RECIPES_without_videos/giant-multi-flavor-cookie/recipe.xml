  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the base cookie dough. In a large bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, granulated sugar, salt, and butter until a paste has combined with no lumps. </step>
    <step num="1">Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk. </step>
    <step num="2">Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula, being careful not to overmix. This will cause the gluten in the flour to toughen, which will result in cakier cookies. </step>
    <step num="3">Divide the dough evenly between 6 medium bowls. </step>
    <step num="4">Make chocolate chip cookie dough by adding the chocolate chips to the first bowl. Mix well and set aside. </step>
    <step num="5">Make peanut butter cookie dough by adding the peanuts and peanut butter to the second bowl. Mix well and set aside. </step>
    <step num="6">Make white chocolate macadamia nut cookie dough by adding the white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts to the third bowl. Mix well and set aside. </step>

    <step num="9">Make caramel and pretzel cookie dough by adding chopped caramel and pretzels to the sixth bowl. Mix well and set aside. </step>
    <step num="10">Line a 10-inch (30 cm) cast iron skillet with parchment paper. Make a triangular shape with the chocolate chip cookie dough and press into ⅙ of the pan. Repeat with the remaining doughs. </step>
    <step num="11">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="12">Chill the pan for at least 30 minutes, up to overnight. </step>
