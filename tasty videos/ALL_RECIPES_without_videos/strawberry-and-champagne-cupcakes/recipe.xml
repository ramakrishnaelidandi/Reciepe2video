    <step num="0">Prepare the coconut cream by whipping the coconut cream and icing sugar together, until you form soft peaks. </step>
    <step num="1">Leave to chill in the fridge until set, for about 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180°C (350˚F) and line a cupcake tray with 12 cases. </step>
    <step num="3">Make the cupcakes by mixing the coconut oil, maple syrup, and almond milk together. </step>

    <step num="6">Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown and springy to the touch. </step>
    <step num="7">While the cakes are baking, make the strawberry champagne syrup by bringing the sugar, water, strawberries, and champagne to the boil in a saucepan over a medium-high heat. </step>
    <step num="8">Simmer until the syrup is slightly thicker and has changed colour to a deep red. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="9">Take the cakes out of the oven and leave to cool slightly for a couple of minutes. </step>
