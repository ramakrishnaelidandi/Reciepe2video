    <step num="0">Crush all graham crackers into large chunks. Around the size of a quarter works best. </step>

    <step num="3">Place mixture in a large dish and spread evenly. </step>

    <step num="5">Cover with melted chocolate. </step>
    <step num="6">Cut into equal pieces. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
