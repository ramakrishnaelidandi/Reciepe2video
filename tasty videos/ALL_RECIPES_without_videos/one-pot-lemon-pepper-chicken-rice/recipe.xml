  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat your oven to 350˚F (175˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Combine lemon pepper, paprika, and 2 cloves of minced garlic in a small bowl. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large oven-proof pot, heat olive oil on medium heat. Season both sides of the chicken and place in the pot skin side down. Cook for three minutes, turn the heat up to medium high and cook for an additional two minutes (or until browned). Turn the chicken over and cook for another 3-4 minutes. Remove chicken from the pot and set aside. (Don’t worry! It will finish cooking when you put it in the oven.) </step>
    <step num="3">With a paper towel, carefully wipe out excess fat, leaving the seasoning. </step>
    <step num="4">On medium high, melt two Tbsp. of butter in the pot and add the diced onions and the rest of the minced garlic. Cook until onions are translucent (1-2 minutes). </step>
    <step num="5">Add the rice and stir until it becomes translucent (1-2 minutes). </step>
    <step num="6">Pour in the white wine and let it cook until most of the wine has evaporated (about two minutes). </step>
    <step num="7">Add the chicken broth, one cup of milk, and a dash of pepper and stir. Bring it to a simmer. </step>
    <step num="8">Place the chicken back into the pot. Cover with a lid or foil and bake for 30 minutes (remove lid after 20 minutes). </step>
    <step num="9">Remove the chicken from the pot and broil on high for 2-3 minutes or until the skin has nicely browned. </step>
    <step num="10">Add the other two Tbsp. butter, parmesan, ½ cup (118 ml) of milk and parsley to the rice. Stir until well combined. Return the chicken on top of the rice. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
