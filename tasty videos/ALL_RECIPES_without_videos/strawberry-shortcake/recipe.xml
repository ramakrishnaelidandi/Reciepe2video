  <steps>
    <step num="0">Marinate the strawberries: in a medium bowl, combine the strawberries, sugar, lemon zest, and salt. Set aside to marinate while you make the shortcakes. </step>
    <step num="1">Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the cubed butter and, using your fingers, cut in the butter until pea-sized pieces form and the mixture starts to clump together. Add 1 cup (240 ml) cream and mix just to combine. </step>
    <step num="3">Transfer the mixture to a clean work surface and pat into a ¾-inch-thick (2 cm) rectangle. Cut into 8 squares. Use a pastry brush to brush the tops of each square with the remaining 1½ tablespoons of heavy cream and sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of sugar and flaky salt. </step>
    <step num="4">Bake for 20 minutes, until the shortcakes are cooked through and golden on top. </step>
    <step num="5">Cool the shortcakes, then split and serve with the marinated strawberries and whipped cream. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
