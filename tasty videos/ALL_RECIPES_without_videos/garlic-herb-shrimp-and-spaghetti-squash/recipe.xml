  <steps>
    <step num="0">Using a fork or knife, carefully poke holes along the middle of the squash. </step>
    <step num="1">Microwave for 5 minutes so the squash softens and is easier to cut. </step>
    <step num="2">Cut in half horizontally and scoop out the seeds. </step>
    <step num="3">Drizzle olive oil, salt, and pepper. </step>
    <step num="4">Place in the Instant Pot and secure the lid until you hear the beep. Tip: Closing the lid can be tricky. Have the pressure knob at 11 o’clock and turn right. </step>
    <step num="5">Set the pressure knob on the top of the lid to Sealing. Select “Manual” and reduce to 7 minutes. It will say “On” in a few seconds. Note: the Instant Pot will need to warm up for 5-10 minutes. Steam will be released and a few minutes later, the time will start counting down. </step>
    <step num="6">While the squash is cooking, prepare the shrimp. Place the shrimp in a bowl and add the minced garlic, onion powder, parsley, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Mix until combined. Refrigerate until ready to cook. </step>
    <step num="7">Once the 7 minutes is up, let the squash rest in the pot for 5 minutes. It will count up and read “L 0:05”. </step>
    <step num="8">Using a towel or mit, release the pressure knob from “Sealing” to “Venting”. After the steam has been released, carefully take the squash out of the pot and let it rest in a bowl. </step>
    <step num="9">Drain the excess liquid and clean the pot. </step>
    <step num="10">To cook the shrimp, select “Saute” on the Instant Pot. Once it says “Hot”, add the oil. When the oil is shimmering, add the shrimp in a single layer (cook in batches if necessary). Cook for 3-5 minutes per side or until opaque. </step>
    <step num="11">Press “Cancel” and remove the shrimp. </step>
    <step num="12">Using a fork, shred the inside of the squash. </step>
    <step num="13">Serve the spaghetti squash and shrimp together. If desired, top with parmesan cheese and fresh parsley. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
