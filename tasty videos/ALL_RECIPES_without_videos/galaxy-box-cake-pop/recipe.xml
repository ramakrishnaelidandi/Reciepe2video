  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Prepare the yellow cake batter according to package instructions and pour into greased pan. </step>
    <step num="2">Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature. </step>
    <step num="3">In a medium bowl, crumble the cake. Add vanilla frosting to give some moisture to the cake. If it is too dry add more frosting. </step>
    <step num="4">Using a small ice cream scoop, portion the cake and shape into a ball. Repeat with remaining cake. </step>
    <step num="5">Dip a popsicle stick tip into the melted white chocolate and insert into the cake balls. Freeze for at least 30 minutes. </step>

    <step num="8">Remove the pan from the heat and add the bloomed gelatin. Whisk until well combined. </step>
    <step num="9">Add the white chocolate to a bowl. Pour the condensed milk mixture through a sieve into the bowl of chocolate and let it sit for 2 minutes to soften the chocolate. </step>
    <step num="10">Using a emersion blender, blend the chocolate until smooth. Transfer the mixture into a deep container such as a mug. </step>
    <step num="11">Squeeze light blue, purple, then navy food coloring into the mug or bowl without stirring. </step>
