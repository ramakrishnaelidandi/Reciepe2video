  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">Make the cookie butter: In a food processor, combine the butter, evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and cookies. Process until the cookies break down and the mixture is the texture of peanut butter. </step>
    <step num="2">Using a small ice cream scoop or your hands, scoop 12 ½-inch (1 ¼ cm) balls of the cookie butter onto the prepared baking sheet. Freeze for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Make the cookie dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla until light and fluffy. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the egg and whisk to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="5">Sift in the flour, cinnamon, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt. Fold with a rubber spatula to combine. </step>
    <step num="6">Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill the dough for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Make the cinnamon sugar: In a small bowl, mix together the sugar and cinnamon. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="8">Roll the cookie dough into 24 ½-inch (1 ¼ cm) balls. </step>
    <step num="9">Flatten a dough ball in your hand and add a cookie butter ball to the center. Top with another flattened ball of cookie dough and pinch the edges of the dough together. Roll into a ball to completely encase the cookie butter. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. </step>
    <step num="10">Roll the cookie dough balls in the cinnamon sugar to coat. </step>
    <step num="11">Place the cookie balls on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing about 3 inches (7 ½ cm) apart – there should be 6 per baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="12">Bake for 12 minutes, until the edges are light golden brown. </step>
    <step num="13">Let cool, then serve. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
