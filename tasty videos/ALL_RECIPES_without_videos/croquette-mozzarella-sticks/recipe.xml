  <steps>
    <step num="0">Add the potatoes to a large pot with enough cold water to cover them. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until tender when pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Drain the potatoes and transfer to a large bowl. Use a potato masher to mash the potatoes until there are no large chunks left. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the garlic, parsley, Parmesan cheese, 1 beaten egg, salt, and pepper. Mix well. </step>
    <step num="3">Take a spoonful of potatoes and form into a patty. </step>
    <step num="4">Place a cheese stick in the middle and wrap the potato around the cheese until it is evenly covered. </step>
    <step num="5">Arrange the formed croquettes on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Place the flour, 3 remaining eggs, and bread crumbs in 3 separate shallow bowls. Dredge the croquettes in the flour, shaking off any excess; then dredge in the egg and the bread crumbs. </step>
    <step num="7">Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350°F (180°C). Fry the croquettes for 3 minutes, or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="8">Transfer the croquettes to a wire rack set over paper towels to drain the excess oil. </step>
    <step num="9">Let cool for a few minutes as they will be HOT. </step>
    <step num="10">Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese and parsley and serve with marinara sauce alongside. </step>
