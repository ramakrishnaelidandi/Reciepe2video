  <steps>
    <step num="0">Pre-heat the oven to 180°C (350°F). </step>
    <step num="1">In a small bowl, steep the teabags in the hot water for about 5-10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Let cool and take the teabags out, keeping the water. </step>
    <step num="3">In a blender, blend the the medjool dates, cinnamon, nutmeg and teabag water to a smooth puree. </step>
    <step num="4">For the cake, in a large bowl add the butter and both sugars, cream together using a wooden spoon until light and fluffy. </step>
    <step num="5">Next, beat in the eggs one by one, using a metal spoon. </step>
    <step num="6">Fold in the flour, followed by the puree. </step>
    <step num="7">Pour into a thoroughly greased bundt cake tin and smooth out the top. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake in the oven for about 45 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through. </step>
    <step num="9">Prepare the caramel sauce by melting the butter and two sugars together in a saucepan over a low-medium heat. </step>
    <step num="10">Stir in the rum and double cream. </step>
    <step num="11">Bring to the boil and simmer for about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="12">Pour into a jug and leave to cool. </step>
    <step num="13">Once the cake is ready, flip onto a cooling rack. </step>
    <step num="14">Using a pastry brush, gently brush some of the caramel sauce all over the bundt cake so that it is completely covered. This will help keep the cake nice and moist. </step>
    <step num="15">Pour what’s left of the caramel over the top of the cake. </step>
    <step num="16">Enjoy! </step>
