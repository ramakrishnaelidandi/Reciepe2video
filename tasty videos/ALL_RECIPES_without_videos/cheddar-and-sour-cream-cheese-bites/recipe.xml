  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a food processor, or by hand, crush ½ a box of Triscuits. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="1">Combine all of the filling ingredients in a large bowl. </step>
    <step num="2">Pinch off bite sized balls of filling and roll between your hands (about 1 oz or 28g each). </step>
    <step num="3">Roll the balls in the crushed Triscuit mixture, then coat it in beaten egg, then again in Triscuit mixture. </step>
    <step num="4">Heat a sauce pan of vegetable oil to 350˚F (180˚C). Line a tray with paper towel to drain the fried bites. </step>
    <step num="5">Fry each bite until Triscuit coating turns a light brown, about 45 seconds. </step>
    <step num="6">NOTE: If they’re fried too long, the cheese filling will escape and you’ll be left with a sad shell of a former cheese bite. </step>
    <step num="7">Garnish with more chopped dill and a squeeze of lemon. Serve immediately. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
