    <step num="0">Place the apple peels and cores (optional) in a quart-sized jar with a wide mouth. </step>
    <step num="1">Cover the peels completely with the water. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the sugar and stir. </step>
    <step num="3">Make sure your scraps are completely covered with water. </step>
    <step num="4">Cover the mouth of the jar with a coffee filter or a thin cloth, then screw on the outer ring of the lid. </step>
    <step num="5">Let sit in a dark area at room temperature for 1-2 weeks, stirring the mix once a day to stimulate proper fermentation and prevent mold from forming. </step>
    <step num="6">When you notice some fizz and a significant amount of bubbles on the surface, strain out the scraps and compost them. </step>
    <step num="7">Put the liquid back in the jar, cover with a coffee filter or a thin cloth, and let it sit. </step>
    <step num="8">Taste it once a week and once it has reached your desired level acidity, cover with a lid or transfer to a closed bottle to stop the fermentation. </step>
    <step num="9">The apple cider vinegar will keep for about a year in the refrigerator. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
