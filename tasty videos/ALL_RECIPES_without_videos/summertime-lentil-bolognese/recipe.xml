  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a food processor, combine the carrots, onion, celery, and garlic. Pulse until finely chopped, but not mushy. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the walnuts to the food processor and pulse until they reach the consistency of ground meat. </step>
    <step num="2">Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable mixture, basil, oregano, parsley, and salt. Cook for 25 minutes, stirring frequently, until caramelized and any excess moisture has evaporated. Add the tomato paste, stir to combine, and cook for 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the vegetable stock, lentils, ground walnuts, and tomatoes and season with salt. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and simmer for 35 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are cooked through and walnuts have softened. Remove the lid and cook off any remaining liquid, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the wine, stir, and reduce until there is no liquid at the bottom of the pot, about 10 minutes. Season with more salt to taste. </step>
    <step num="5">Trim the ends of the zucchini, then cut into noodles using a spiralizer or julienne peeler. </step>
    <step num="6">Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil, a pinch of salt, the red pepper flakes, and garlic to a large pan. Turn the heat to medium and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant. </step>
    <step num="7">Work in batches, add about 2-3 cups of zucchini noodles at a time to the pan. Season lightly with salt and cook for 45-60 seconds, tossing continuously with tongs, until warmed through. 9. Add more olive oil, 1 tablespoon at a time, if the pan looks dry. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve the zucchini noodles with the Bolognese. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
