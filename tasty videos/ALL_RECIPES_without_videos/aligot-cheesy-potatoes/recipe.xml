  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large pot over medium-high heat, add the potatoes, garlic, and cover with cold water. Add a big pinch of salt. </step>
    <step num="1">Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Drain potatoes and garlic in a colander and press them through the holes of the colander with a metal spoon back into the pot. Alternatively, use a potato ricer. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the butter and one clove of garlic to the potatoes and stir over medium-low heat with a rubber spatula until melted and smooth. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour in the heavy cream and stir again until combined. </step>
    <step num="5">Gradually add in the cheese, stirring between each addition, until completely melted. </step>
    <step num="6">Continue stirring the potatoes until smooth, thick, and elastic. </step>
    <step num="7">Begin to stretch the potatoes upwards with the spatula. If the mixture is breaking, add in more cheese. If the mixture is too thick add in more cream. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve immediately as a side with roasted veggies or a meat of choice, or alone with fresh chopped garlic! </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
