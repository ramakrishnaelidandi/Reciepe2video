  <steps>
    <step num="0">Create a small mountain of flour and, using a spoon, begin building a hole in the middle. It should end up looking like a small volcano. </step>
    <step num="1">Gradually add eggs in the volcano’s hole, and carefully incorporate eggs and flour. </step>
    <step num="2">Once all ingredients have been mixed, knead the dough by pulling, stretching, and folding for about 3-5 minutes, or until it turns elastic and semi-easy to mold. </step>
    <step num="3">Mold the dough into a sphere, and wrap it in plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes, or until the dough becomes more relaxed, elastic, and much easier to mold. </step>
    <step num="4">Cut the dough in four pieces. Grab the first one, and keep the other wrapped, or cover them with a slightly wet towel to keep them fresh. </step>
    <step num="5">Flatten the first piece, and run it through the widest setting of your pasta maker. Increase the thinness number by one level each time you run the pasta through the machine. </step>
    <step num="6">Once you can see your fingers through the dough, proceed to cut the fettuccine, or any shape you wish. </step>
    <step num="7">In a pot with boiling water and salt, cook the pasta for 2 minutes or until it feels tender to the bite. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve with your favorite pasta sauce. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
