  <steps>
    <step num="0">The night before you intend to make your “cheesecake,” place cashews in a bowl of water and let soak overnight. </step>
    <step num="1">To make the crust, add walnuts, almonds, dates, vanilla extract, water and salt to a food processor or blender and pulse until sticky mounds begin to form. </step>
    <step num="2">Press the crust into a 7-inch (18 cm) springform pan lined with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="3">Drain the cashews well and add to the food processor. Blend until smooth. </step>
    <step num="4">Scrape down the sides of the processor and add lime juice, maple syrup, vanilla extract and lime zest. Blend until smooth, adding the coconut oil half way. </step>
    <step num="5">Spread about ⅓-½ of the mixture on top of your crust to make the first layer. </step>
    <step num="6">Freeze for 30 minutes to set. </step>
    <step num="7">Add blueberries to the remaining cashew mixture and blend until combined. </step>
    <step num="8">Spread the rest of the mixture onto the cheesecake and garnish with fresh lime zest and blueberries. </step>
    <step num="9">Cover with foil and freeze for 3 hours to set, then transfer to the fridge. </step>
