  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the brine: Combine the water, bay leaves, garlic, peppercorns, and salt in a medium pot over medium heat and stir until the salt is dissolved. </step>
    <step num="1">Remove the brine from heat and stir in the ice cubes. </step>
    <step num="2">Once the brine is cooled, add the pork chops to a glass dish and pour the brine over. Chill in the refrigerator for 1-10 hours. </step>
    <step num="3">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="4">Remove the pork chops from the brine and pat dry. Season generously with salt and pepper on both sides. </step>
    <step num="5">Heat the oil in a large cast iron or other ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Add the pork chops and sear without disturbing until caramelized and browned on the first side, about 2 minutes, then flip and sear on the other side. Remove the pork chops from the pan and set aside. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the shallots to the pan and cook until they begin to soften and caramelize, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the turnips and season with salt, then spread in an even layer and let caramelize, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">Stir in the mustard and sage. Cook for 1 minute more. </step>
    <step num="9">Pour in the apple cider and chicken stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low-medium and simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, about 7 minutes. </step>
    <step num="10">Add the collard greens and stir to incorporate. Nestle the pork chops into the sauce, making sure that they are partly submerged. </step>
    <step num="11">Transfer the pan to the oven and cook for about 12 minutes, until the internal temperature of the pork chops reaches 135˚F (57˚C). </step>
    <step num="12">Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes as the internal temperature continues to climb to 145˚F (63˚C). </step>
    <step num="13">Divide the pork chops, vegetables, and sauce between plates and serve. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
