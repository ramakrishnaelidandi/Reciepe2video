  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 425˚F (220˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Cut vegetables. Place each in a separate corner of a baking pan lined with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="2">NOTE: Broccoli and Brussels sprouts cook faster, keep the cuts thicker for those. Sweet potato and carrots take more time - dice them, or cut them thinner. </step>
    <step num="3">Season veggies with olive oil, salt, pepper, rosemary, thyme, and garlic. </step>
    <step num="4">Season both sides of the chicken with olive oil, salt, pepper, and the remaining rosemary, thyme, and garlic over parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="5">Seal parchment paper to keep chicken moist, and place on the center of the baking pan. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 25-30 minutes, until chicken is fully cooked and veggies are done to your liking. </step>
    <step num="7">This meal works great with brown rice, so feel free to add some to your meal prep as well. </step>
    <step num="8">Unwrap and slice the chicken. </step>
    <step num="9">Separate veggies into each tupperware with chicken. </step>
    <step num="10">NOTE: If using plastic tupperware, allow food to cool down first </step>
    <step num="11">Can be refrigerated up to 4 days. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
