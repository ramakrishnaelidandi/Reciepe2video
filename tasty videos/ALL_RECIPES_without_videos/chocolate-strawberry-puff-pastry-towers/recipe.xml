  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Cut the puff pastry into 6 equal rectangles. </step>
    <step num="2">Taking one of the rectangles, cut diagonally to create 2 triangles. </step>
    <step num="3">Taking one of the triangles make 2 cuts on each of the long sides of the triangles leaving 1 centimeter from the edge. Make sure the cuts do not touch at top point of the triangle and leave about 1-inch from the bottom edge of the triangle. </step>
    <step num="4">Make 2 more cuts parallel and 1 centimeter from first 2 cuts. Make sure the cuts do not touch at top point of the triangle and leave about 1 inch from the bottom edge of the triangle. </step>
    <step num="5">Make one vertical cut in the center of the triangle that does not touch any of the other cuts. It should be 2 inches long and 1 inch from the bottom. </step>
    <step num="6">Place 1 teaspoon of chocolate hazelnut spread on the bottom of the triangle where the dough is not cut. </step>
    <step num="7">Place a piece of strawberry over the chocolate hazelnut spread. </step>
    <step num="8">Fold one of the bottom corners over the strawberry and fold the other bottom corner over that corner, press down to seal. </step>
    <step num="9">Repeat with the remaining pastry triangles. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake for 15–20 minutes until pastry is golden brown and puffed. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
