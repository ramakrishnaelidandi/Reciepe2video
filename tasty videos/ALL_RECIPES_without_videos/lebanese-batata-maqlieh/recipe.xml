  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the garlic sauce: Add the garlic and salt to a food processor and process until completely smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. </step>
    <step num="1">With the processor running, slowly pour in ½ cup (120 ml) of olive oil and continue to process until smooth and creamy. The mixture should begin to thicken as the oil emulsifies with the garlic. </step>
    <step num="2">Pour in 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, while continuing to process, so that the lemon juice incorporates completely and the mixture does not separate. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the remaining olive oil and 2 tablespoons lemon juice and process until very smooth. Transfer the sauce to a small bowl. </step>
    <step num="4">Serve the fries with the garlic sauce and sprinkle with parsley. </step>
    <step num="5">Enjoy! </step>
