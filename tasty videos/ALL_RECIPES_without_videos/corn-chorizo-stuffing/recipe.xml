  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="1">To make the cornbread, place the cornmeal in a large bowl and sift in the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda, and whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">In a separate bowl, beat together the eggs, buttermilk, milk and honey. </step>
    <step num="3">Whisk the cornmeal mixture into the liquid mixture. Do not overwork the batter. </step>
    <step num="4">Use a tablespoon of the melted butter to grease a 9” (23 cm) baking pan. Whisk the rest of the melted butter into the batter just until combined. Bake 35-40 mins until tester comes out clean. Set aside to cool. </step>
    <step num="5">Turn oven down to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="6">In a cast iron pan, brown the chorizo until the fat is rendered out. Remove chorizo from pan and set aside. Remove half of the fat from the pan and discard. </step>
    <step num="7">In the same chorizo pan, add potatoes, onions, carrots, celery, garlic and saute until soft and caramelized. </step>
    <step num="8">Place the cubed cornbread and Hawaiian rolls on a baking sheet in a single layer. Toast in the oven until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="9">In a large bowl, mix together chorizo and cooked vegetables. Carefully mix in stock, adding in increments until moist but not wet to avoid mushy stuffing. Season to taste with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="10">Place stuffing in a baking dish and top with a few slices of butter, place in the oven and bake for about 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="11">Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve immediately. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
