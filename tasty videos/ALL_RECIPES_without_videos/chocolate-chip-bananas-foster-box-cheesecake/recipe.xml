  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large mixing bowl, use a fork to mash the ripe bananas. </step>
    <step num="2">Whisk in the egg, followed by vegetable oil and milk. Mix until combined. </step>
    <step num="3">Add in the yellow cake mix, being careful to not overmix. </step>
    <step num="4">Use a rubber spatula to gently fold in the chocolate chips. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="5">In a shallow saucepan, set over medium heat, add the butter and brown sugar, and stir constantly with a wooden spoon until the mixture turns into golden brown syrup, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour the syrup into a 9-inch (20-cm) round cake pan. Place the sliced bananas into a single layer on top of the syrup. </step>
    <step num="7">Divide the cake batter among the banana pan, and another greased 9-inch (20-cm) cake pan. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean from the center. </step>
    <step num="9">Once the banana bottom cake is cool to touch, invert onto a cooling rack set on top of a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Leave the second cake to cool to room temperature inside the pan. </step>
    <step num="10">In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the cream cheese and sugar until light and fluffy. </step>
    <step num="11">Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Add in the sour cream and vanilla extract, and mix until combined. </step>
    <step num="12">Pour the cheesecake batter into the cooled cake in the pan. Cover the bottom of the pan with two sheets of foil and place into a larger baking dish. </step>
    <step num="13">Fill the baking dish with water until it comes 1 inch (2 cm) up the side on the cake pan. </step>
    <step num="14">Bake for 1 hour. Turn the heat off and open the oven door and let cool for one hour. Refrigerate the cake for 4 hours. </step>
    <step num="15">To assemble, remove the cheesecake from the springform pan. Top the cake with the cooled banana fosters cake. </step>
    <step num="16">Enjoy! </step>
