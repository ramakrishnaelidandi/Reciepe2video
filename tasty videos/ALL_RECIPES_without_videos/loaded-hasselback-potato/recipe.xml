  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Lay 2 chopsticks about 2-3 inches apart on a cutting board. </step>
    <step num="2">Place a potato lengthwise between the chopsticks, making sure the potato touches the cutting board. </step>
    <step num="3">Make ¼-inch slices across the potato, making sure you do not cut through the bottom of the potato. The chopsticks will help serve as a bumper of sorts to prevent this from happening. Repeat with the second potato. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the potatoes to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, then brush the butter evenly on both of the potatoes. </step>
    <step num="5">Sprinkle a bit of salt and pepper on top of the potatoes, then bake for about 30 minutes until the slices of each potato have started to separate and crisp up. To have a better separation between the slices, pull the slices apart before they are baked. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove the potatoes and lower the oven heat to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="7">Place a square of cheddar cheese in between the slits in the potatoes, then return to the oven and bake for about 10 minutes, until the cheese is melted and starting to bubble. </step>
    <step num="8">Garnish each potato with a dollop of sour cream, bacon, and green onions. </step>
    <step num="9">Serve and enjoy! </step>
