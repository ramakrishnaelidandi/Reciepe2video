  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the macaron batter: In a large bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and almond meal. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="1">In a separate large bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric hand mixer until the egg whites stay stuck to the sides of the bowl when tilted. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the granulated sugar and beat until soft peaks form. </step>
    <step num="3">Gradually add the dry ingredients to the whipped egg whites and fold with a rubber spatula until just combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer half of the batter to another bowl. </step>
    <step num="5">Make the gingerbread flavor: To one bowl, add the cloves, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice, and gently fold to combine. </step>
    <step num="6">Make the red velvet flavor: To the other bowl, add the cocoa powder and red food coloring, and gently fold to combine. </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer the batters to 2 separate piping bags or zip-top bags. </step>
    <step num="8">Pipe a bit of batter in each of the 4 corners of the baking sheet, then lay a piece of parchment paper on top and press against the batter dots to seal. Pipe the batter onto the baking sheet in ¾-inch (2 cm) circles, spacing about ½ inches (1 ¼ cm) apart. Gently tap the baking sheet against the counter to release any air bubbles. </step>
    <step num="9">Let the macarons rest at room temperature for 1 hour, until a skin forms on the surface. </step>
    <step num="10">Preheat the oven to 300˚F (150˚C). </step>
    <step num="11">Bake the macarons for 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="12">Make the filling: In a large bowl, cream together the butter and shortening until smooth. </step>
    <step num="13">Add the salt, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, and eggnog, and beat to incorporate. Add the powdered sugar, a bit at a time, and beat until well combined and the filling is smooth. </step>
    <step num="14">Transfer the eggnog filling to a piping bag or zip-top bag. </step>
    <step num="15">Pipe the filling onto a macaron, then sandwich with another macaron. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. </step>
    <step num="16">Let the macarons rest in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, or overnight. </step>
    <step num="17">To assemble the tower, insert a toothpick into the styrofoam cone, leaving ½-inch (1 ¼ cm) exposed. Gently press a macaron onto the toothpick. Repeat around the rest of the cone with the remaining macarons. </step>
    <step num="18">Enjoy! </step>
