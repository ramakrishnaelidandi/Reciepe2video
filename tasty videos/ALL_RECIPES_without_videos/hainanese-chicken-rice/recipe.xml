  <steps>
    <step num="0">To clean the chicken, rub all over with a handful of kosher salt, getting rid of any loose skin. Rinse the chicken well inside and out. Pat dry with paper towels. </step>
    <step num="1">Remove any excess fat from the chicken and set aside for later. </step>
    <step num="2">Season the chicken generously with salt. Stuff the chicken cavity with the ginger slices and scallions. </step>
    <step num="3">Place the chicken in a large stock pot, cover with cold water by 1 inch (2 cm), and season with salt to taste. </step>
    <step num="4">Bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately reduce the heat to low to maintain a simmer. Cover and cook for about 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F (75°C). Remove the pot from the heat. </step>
    <step num="5">Remove the chicken from the pot, reserving the poaching liquid for later, and transfer to an ice bath for 5 minutes to stop the cooking process and to keep the chicken skin springy. Discard the ginger and green onion. </step>
    <step num="6">After it’s cooled, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and rub all over with sesame oil. This will help prevent the chicken from drying out. </step>
    <step num="7">In a large wok or skillet, heat ¼ cup (60 ml) of sesame oil over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved chopped chicken fat, the garlic, ginger, and salt, and fry until aromatic, about 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">Reserve ¼ of the fried garlic mixture, then add the rice to the remaining fried garlic and stir to coat. Cook for 3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Transfer the rice to a rice cooker and add 2 cups (480 ml) of reserved poaching broth. Steam the rice for 60 minutes, or until tender. </step>
    <step num="10">While the rice is cooking, carve the chicken for serving. </step>
    <step num="11">Make the chili sauce: combine the sambal, Sriracha, sugar, garlic, ginger, lime juice, and chicken broth in a small bowl and stir to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="12">Make the ginger garlic sauce: in a small bowl, combine the ginger, garlic, salt, peanut oil, and rice vinegar, and stir to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="13">Make the soy sauce: in a small bowl, combine the reserved fried garlic and ginger with the oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, and chicken broth, and stir to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="14">Serve the sliced chicken with the rice, dipping sauces, sliced cucumbers, and fresh cilantro. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
