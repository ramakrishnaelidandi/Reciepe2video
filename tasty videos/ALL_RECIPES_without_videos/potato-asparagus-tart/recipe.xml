  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC). </step>
    <step num="1">Thinly slice potatoes. </step>
    <step num="2">Soak potatoes in just enough cold water to cover the potatoes for 10 minutes. Then pat dry. </step>
    <step num="3">In a medium bowl, mix together heavy cream, salt, Italian seasoning, black pepper and melted butter. </step>
    <step num="4">Add potato slices and evenly coat every piece in the cream mixture. </step>
    <step num="5">Line baking tray with parchment paper and place one sheet of puff pastry. With a fork, evenly poke the entire sheet. </step>
    <step num="6">Place shredded or grated parmesan cheese on the puff pastry. Then layer each potato slice to cover the sheet, leaving ½ inch on all sides. </step>
    <step num="7">With 2 spoons, scoop small amounts of goat cheese on top of the potatoes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 30 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. </step>
    <step num="9">With a peeler hold the bottom of the asparagus and carefully peel from bottom to the tip. Peel twice on one side, then flip over to peel the other side. It will give you a even ribbon. </step>
    <step num="10">Put all the asparagus ribbons into a bowl and mix in salt, pepper, olive oil and lemon juice. Toss the ribbons until evenly coated. </step>
    <step num="11">Place the asparagus ribbons on top of the freshly baked potato tart, then slice. </step>
