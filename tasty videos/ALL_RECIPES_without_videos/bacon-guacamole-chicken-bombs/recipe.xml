  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Using a knife, cut around the pit of the avocado, separating the halves from each other. Remove the pit and use a spoon to scoop out the avocado. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, combine the avocado, onion, tomato, cilantro, salt, and lime juice. Mash and stir with a fork until there are no large chunks of avocado left. </step>
    <step num="3">Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper on all sides. Slice chicken breasts in half crosswise. </step>
    <step num="4">Cut a slit into the center of each half to make a pocket. Take a heaping spoonful of the guacamole and pack it into the pocket. Pinch the edges of the chicken closed. </step>
    <step num="5">Wrap the chicken with two strips of bacon, making sure the ends of the bacon all end up on the same side of the chicken. </step>
    <step num="6">Heat oil in a pan over high heat. Sear the bacon-wrapped chicken for two to three minutes on each side. Remember to cook the sides of the chicken as well. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 10 minutes and then serve. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
