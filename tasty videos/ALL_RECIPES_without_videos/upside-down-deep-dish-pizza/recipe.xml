  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a 12-inch (30 cm) cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the onion and cook until softened, about 4 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the green pepper and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">Turn off the heat. Grease the pan with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="4">Arrange the pepperoni in an even layer on the bottom of the pan. Top with the green peppers, onions, Parmesan, and mozzarella. Arrange the provolone slices over the shredded cheese in an even layer. Top with the pizza sauce and spread evenly. </step>
    <step num="5">On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pizza dough to a 12-inch (30 cm) round. Gently lay the pizza dough over the pizza sauce, making sure the dough reaches to the edges all around. Brush the dough with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 25 minutes, until the dough is golden brown. </step>
    <step num="7">Carefully remove the skillet from the oven. Place a large baking sheet on top, then quickly invert the pizza onto the pan. </step>
    <step num="8">Return to the oven and bake for another 20 minutes, until the pepperoni begins to crisp. </step>
    <step num="9">Slice into 8 wedges, then serve. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
