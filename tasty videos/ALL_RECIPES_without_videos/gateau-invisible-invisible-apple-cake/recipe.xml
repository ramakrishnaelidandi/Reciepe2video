  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the Gâteau Invisible: Peel the apples and remove the cores. Slice them very thinly. </step>
    <step num="1">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="2">In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar until pale. Add the milk and melted butter and mix well. </step>
    <step num="3">Sift in the flour and combine. Add the sliced apples. Using a rubber spatula, coat the apples well with the batter. </step>
    <step num="4">Spoon the apples into a parchment paper-lined loaf pan, then pour over the remaining batter. Top with sliced almonds. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 40 minutes. Cover with a foil and bake another 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Let cool, then remove the cake from the pan. </step>
    <step num="7">Make the butter caramel sauce. In a microwave-safe bowl, add the sugar and butter. Microwave 2 minutes or until sugar turns dark brown. Using oven mitts, very carefully take the bowl from the microwave. The bowl and sugar will be extremely hot so be careful when you are handling them. </step>
    <step num="8">Immediately add the cream and whisk well with a metal spoon or whisk (this will splatter a bit, but keep stirring!). </step>
    <step num="9">Pour the caramel over the cake and serve. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
