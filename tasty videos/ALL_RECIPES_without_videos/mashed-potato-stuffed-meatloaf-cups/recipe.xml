  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Place cooked potatoes into a large bowl. Add butter, salt, pepper, parmesan, and a splash of milk. Mash and add more milk gradually until the potatoes are the desired texture. Set aside and let cool. </step>
    <step num="2">Prepare the glaze by mixing ketchup, brown sugar, onion powder, mustard powder, and paprika in a bowl. Reserve half in a separate bowl to glaze once cooked. </step>
    <step num="3">Add oil in a skillet over medium heat, followed by onions and garlic. Cook until onions are translucent and fragrant. Set aside in a bowl to cool before adding to the meat mixture. </step>
    <step num="4">In a large bowl, combine ground beef, salt, pepper, worcestershire sauce, parmesan, parsley, cooled onions &amp; garlic, egg, breadcrumbs and milk. Mix until combined. </step>
    <step num="5">Using a spoon or ice cream scooper, scoop the meat mixture and place into a greased 12 cup cupcake baking tin. </step>
    <step num="6">Using your fingers, spread the meat from the center to make a cup. Fill the middle with a small spoonful of mashed potatoes, and cover back up with the meat mixture. </step>
    <step num="7">Generously brush half of the reserved glaze on top of the meatloaf cups generously. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 25 minutes, reapplying the glaze halfway through. Once they are done cooking, brush with the remaining glaze that has Not been used on the raw meatloaves. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
