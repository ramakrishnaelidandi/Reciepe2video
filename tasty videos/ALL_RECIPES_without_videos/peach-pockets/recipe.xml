  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and sugar. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the coconut oil to the dry ingredients and mix together using a fork or your fingers. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the cold water to the dough, a little at a time, and continue to mix until dough forms a ball. </step>
    <step num="4">Cut dough into two equal parts and flatten them into 1-inch (2 ½ cm) thick disks. Wrap the disks in plastic wrap and chill for one hour. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the peach preserves and butter to a small microwave-safe bowl and heat in the microwave for about 20 seconds or until butter has melted. Stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="6">Dice the peaches and put them in a medium bowl. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the preserve mixture, lemon juice, and cinnamon to the peaches and mix until peaches are well-coated. </step>
    <step num="8">Remove one of the dough disks from the refrigerator. </step>
    <step num="9">Lightly flour your work surface, dough, and rolling pin. </step>
    <step num="10">Roll out the dough to form a large rectangle about ⅛-inch (3 mm) thick. </step>
    <step num="11">Cut the dough into an even number of small rectangles. </step>
    <step num="12">Beat the egg in a small bowl. Brush the edges of half of the rectangles with the egg wash. </step>
    <step num="13">Spoon one tablespoon of the peach mixture into the center of each brushed rectangle. </step>
    <step num="14">Place another rectangle of the same size over the one with the filling. Lightly press down. </step>
    <step num="15">Use a fork to seal the edges around each rectangle, then lightly poke the tops of each rectangle a few times. Brush the edges and tops of the dough with the egg wash. </step>
    <step num="16">Place the pockets on parchment-lined baking sheets and place in the freezer as you repeat the same process with the other dough disk. </step>
    <step num="17">Bake for 30-35 minutes or until dough is golden brown. </step>
    <step num="18">For the glaze, mix together powdered sugar and milk until smooth. </step>
    <step num="19">Drizzle peach pockets with glaze and serve. </step>
