  <steps>
    <step num="0">Pour a cup of sugar (200g) and ⅓ cups (80ml) of passion fruit juice into a saucepan over a medium heat. Let the sugar melt and form a golden color. Don't over stir. Take off the heat. </step>
    <step num="1">Spoon the caramel into each ramekin, and swirl it around so the bottom is covered. Set aside to cool. </step>
    <step num="2">In another saucepan, heat heavy cream, whole milk, vanilla extract, and two tablespoons of passion fruit juice. Stir until well mixed and hot. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large bowl, mix egg yolks, eggs, and gradually pour in the hot passion fruit cream mixture until fully incorporated. Pour the mixture through a sieve to make the mixture smooth. </step>
    <step num="4">Place the ramekins into a large roasting pan. Pour hot water into the pan to come roughly halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Pour the mixture into the ramekins and bake at 350˚F (180˚C) for 45 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Let the flan cool outside the oven, and then refrigerate it for at least two hours. </step>
    <step num="6">When you're ready to serve the flan, run a knife around the edges to loosen, place a dish over the top of the ramekin and quickly invert it. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
