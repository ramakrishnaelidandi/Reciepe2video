  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Add the oil to a pan on medium-high heat and cook the onions and garlic until deeply caramelized. </step>
    <step num="2">Mix in tomato sauce, tomato paste, red pepper flakes, dried basil and oregano. Bring to a simmer for 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Add pre-cooked meatballs and coat them with sauce. Remove sauce from heat. </step>
    <step num="4">Roll out three rectangles of puff pastry. One should be 16-inches (41 cm) long, one 22-inches (56 cm) long and the third, 28-inches (71 cm) long. All three should be about 6-inches (15 cm) wide. </step>
    <step num="5">Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese in a line across the bottom of each strip, then place meatballs on top in a line about 1-inch (2 cm) apart from each other. </step>
    <step num="6">Roll pastry over the meatballs. Then take the smallest roll and wrap it around a small oven safe bowl placed on top of a baking sheet. Make sure the ends of the pastry meet and pat together to connect. </step>
    <step num="7">Take a knife and press down the puff pastry between each meatball creating a small opening on either side of the puff pastry. Make a small cut between each meatball just below the top of the puff pastry so that the roll is still connected. </step>
    <step num="8">Repeat this step again with the medium roll and largest roll, wrapping them around each other. </step>
    <step num="9">Add marinara sauce to the oven safe bowl. </step>
    <step num="10">Brush egg wash over the entire ring and sprinkle the shredded parmesan cheese on top. Cover sauce with foil. </step>
    <step num="11">Bake for 25 minutes. </step>
    <step num="12">Serve warm. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
