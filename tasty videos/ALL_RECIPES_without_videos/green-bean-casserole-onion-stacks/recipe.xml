    <step num="0">In a medium bowl, mix together green beans, soup, and French fried onions. </step>
    <step num="1">Spray down a medium-sized baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray and arrange onion rings so that they are all 1.5-2 inches (4-5 cm) apart. </step>
    <step num="2">Using a spoon or spatula, scoop soup/green bean mixture into the middle of each onion ring, making sure to fill each ring evenly before placing another onion ring on top and repeating the process.
