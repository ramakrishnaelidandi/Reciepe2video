  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 170˚F (70˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a food processor or blender, puree strawberries, kiwi, sugar, and lemon juice. </step>
    <step num="2">Over a bowl or jug, pour the puree into a strainer and stir to remove most of the seeds. </step>
    <step num="3">On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, pour the puree and spread evenly over the paper, being careful not to let it spill over the edges. </step>
    <step num="4">Bake for 5 hours, or until it is mostly dehydrated and is no longer sticky. (This may take up to 6 hours depending on the oven.) It is done when it has a bendable, leathery texture. </step>
    <step num="5">Cool completely and cut into strips, leaving the parchment paper attached. </step>
    <step num="6">Roll each strip up and tie with a ribbon or twine. </step>
    <step num="7">To serve, remove ribbon/twine and parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
