    <step num="0">In a bowl, whisk together the strawberries and double cream until they reach soft peaks. </step>
    <step num="1">Sieve the flour and cocoa powder into a bowl. Crack an egg in the middle and add the melted butter. Whisk until combined. </step>
    <step num="2">Slowly add the milk in three batches, whisking until perfectly smooth. </step>
    <step num="3">Heat a small amount of butter over low heat in a nonstick frying pan. </step>
