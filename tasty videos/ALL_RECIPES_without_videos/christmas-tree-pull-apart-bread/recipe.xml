  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Flip a baking sheet upside down and place a piece of parchment paper on top. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, sour cream, and Club House ranch dip seasoning. Stir until well mixed. Fold in the spinach. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Roll out the tube of pizza dough on a piece of parchment paper set on a flat surface. Using a pizza cutter or knife, cut from a bottom corner to the center of the top. Repeat on the other side so you have 1 full triangle and 2 halves of a triangle on either side. </step>
    <step num="3">Transfer both side-triangle pieces to the prepared baking sheet. Pinch the middle seam to seal and stretch the dough to form a single triangle. </step>
    <step num="4">Spread the spinach dip over a side of the triangle. </step>
    <step num="5">Spread the pesto over the other side of the triangle. </step>
    <step num="6">Flip the remaining dough triangle on top of the filling and remove the parchment from the top. Stretch the dough to cover completely. </step>
    <step num="7">Using a pizza cutter or knife, make horizontal slices about 1 inch apart from the top to bottom, leaving the middle “trunk” of the tree intact. </step>
    <step num="8">Pull the strips outwards and twist. </step>
    <step num="9">In a small bowl, mix the melted butter and garlic and brush over the tree. </step>
    <step num="10">Sprinkle with the Club House Italian herbs and shredded Parmesan cheese. </step>
    <step num="11">Bake the tree for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown and the cheese has melted. </step>
    <step num="12">Serve with marinara sauce. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
