  <steps>
    <step num="0">Wash potatoes thoroughly and poke holes in each with a fork. Place into a large bowl. </step>
    <step num="1">Sprinkle with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Make sure each potato is evenly coated. </step>
    <step num="2">Place on a baking sheet covered with foil. </step>

    <step num="6">Melt butter and mix into the large bowl with the potato filling. Mash the potatoes with a fork until consistency is smooth. </step>
    <step num="7">Mix in sour cream, cheddar cheese, bacon, green onion, salt, and pepper and stir until well combined. </step>
    <step num="8">Using a small spoon, stuff each of the hollowed out potatoes with the filling. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake at reduced temperature 375˚F(190˚C) for 5-7 minutes. </step>
