  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Spread the bread in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes, until lightly toasted. Let cool to room temperature. Leave the oven on. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the toasted bread to a food processor and pulse until finely ground. You should have about 4 cups (460 G) of bread crumbs. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs, 4 tablespoons of melted butter, the cheddar cheese, and 1 teaspoon of salt and toss to combine. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">In a medium pot, combine 4 cups (960 ml) of white wine and a generous pinch of salt and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and cook until bright pink, about 1 minute. Use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer the shrimp to a colander to drain. </step>
    <step num="5">Return the wine to a boil. Add the scallops and cook until just opaque, about 2 minutes. Transfer the scallops to a colander to drain. </step>
    <step num="6">Chop the shrimp and scallops into bite-size pieces. Transfer to large bowl, along with the crab and 1 teaspoon of salt. Toss to combine. </step>
    <step num="7">In a liquid measuring cup or medium bowl, whisk together the half-and-half, 3 tablespoons of melted butter, the flour, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, lemon juice, ketchup, remaining tablespoon of white wine, and remaining teaspoon of salt. </step>
    <step num="8">Brush the remaining tablespoon of melted butter in a 9 x 13-inch (22 x 33 cm) baking dish. </step>
    <step num="9">Scatter the artichokes in an even layer over the bottom of the baking dish. Scoop the seafood mixture over the artichokes. Pour the sauce over the seafood. Top with the bread crumb mixture. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake the casserole for 20-25 minutes, or until bubbling and golden brown. </step>
    <step num="11">Top with chives and serve with lemon wedges. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
