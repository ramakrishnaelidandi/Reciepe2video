  <steps>
    <step num="0">Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. </step>
    <step num="1">In a separate large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together with an electric mixer until light, fluffy, and nearly doubled in size, 6-8 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Using a spatula, gently fold in the flour mixture until just combined (some streaks of flour are okay). </step>
    <step num="3">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="4">Combine the milk and vanilla extract in a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, then gently fold into the batter, mixing just to blend. </step>
    <step num="5">Spray 2 9-inch (23 cm) round cake pans with nonstick cooking spray. Divide the batter between the pans. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake until the cakes are golden brown around the edges and spring back slightly when pressed in the center, about 20-25 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">While the cakes are baking, combine the evaporated milk, coconut milk and condensed milk in a liquid measuring cup or small bowl and whisk to blend. </step>
    <step num="8">Once the cakes are done, immediately remove the cakes from the pans and invert them onto a wire rack or baking sheet. Cool for 2 minutes. Then, poke the cakes all over with a fork. </step>
    <step num="9">Return the cakes to the pans. Drizzle the condensed milk mixture over the cakes, letting it soak in. Let sit for 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="10">In a medium bowl, whip the heavy cream and powdered sugar with an electric hand mixer until stiff peaks form. </step>
    <step num="11">Carefully transfer one of the cakes to a cake stand. </step>
    <step num="12">Spread a layer of the whipped cream over the cake. Place the other cake on top and spread with the remaining whipped cream. </step>
    <step num="13">Decorate with berries, if desired. </step>
    <step num="14">Slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
