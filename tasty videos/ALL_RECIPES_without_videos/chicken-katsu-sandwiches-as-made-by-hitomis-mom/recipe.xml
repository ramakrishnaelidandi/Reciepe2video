  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the tonkatsu sauce: In a small bowl, mix together the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and sugar until combined. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="1">Make the sandwich: Heat 2 inches of canola oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat until it reaches 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="2">Slice through the thick part of the chicken thigh so it an even thickness. Season with salt and pepper on both sides. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the flour, egg, and panko to 3 separate shallow dishes. </step>
    <step num="4">Coat the chicken thigh in the flour, then the egg, then the panko. </step>
    <step num="5">To test the oil temperature, add a pinch of panko—if it sizzles immediately, it’s ready for frying. Carefully fry the chicken for about 2 minutes per each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. </step>
    <step num="6">In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise and hot mustard. </step>
    <step num="7">Assemble the sandwiches: Spread the mayonnaise sauce on each piece of toasted bread. On one side, layer on the cabbage, a drizzle of tonkatsu sauce, the chicken, and more tonkatsu sauce. Top with the other slice of bread. </step>
    <step num="8">Cut the sandwich in half, then serve. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
