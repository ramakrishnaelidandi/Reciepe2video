  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a very large pot, combine the water, kosher salt, brown sugar, pink curing salt, garlic, ginger, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, mustard seeds, peppercorns, allspice berries, juniper berries, and cloves. Stir and bring to a boil over high heat. </step>
    <step num="1">Once the brine is boiling, remove from the heat and add the ice to bring the temperature below 45˚F (7˚C). </step>
    <step num="2">Place the brisket in a large plastic storage container with a lid. Pour the cooled brine over the meat. Cover and brine the beef in the refrigerator for 5–7 days, flipping once a day. </step>
    <step num="3">Once the brisket is brined, remove the beef from the liquid and transfer to a pot large enough for it to sit flat on the bottom. Add the onion, celery, carrot, ginger beer, and beer. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and gently simmer for 2½–3 hours, or until the meat is fork-tender. Remove the meat from the pot and let cool. If making corned beef and cabbage, reserve the cooking liquid. Otherwise, discard. </step>
    <step num="4">Thinly slice the brisket against the grain for sandwiches or corned beef and cabbage, or dice for corned beef hash. </step>
    <step num="5">Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the potatoes and onion and season with salt and pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes, until lightly browned. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the corned beef, garlic, paprika, and Worcestershire sauce. Cook for another 1–2 minutes, until the beef is warmed through and slightly crisped. Remove the pan from the heat. </step>
    <step num="7">Serve the hash with the eggs and garnish with chives. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
