  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C). Line 3 11x17-inch (28x43-cm) baking sheets with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">Make the pancake layer: In a large bowl, combine the pancake mix, eggs, milk, and vegetable oil. Whisk to combine, being careful not to overmix. </step>
    <step num="2">Divide batter between 2 of the prepared baking sheets. Spread evenly and bake for 10-15 minutes, until you can poke and no batter comes out </step>
    <step num="3">Make the egg layer: In a large bowl, combine the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour the egg mix onto the remaining prepared baking sheet. Spread evenly and bake for 10-15 minutes, until the edges are completely set. </step>
    <step num="5">Line another baking sheet with 2 sheets of parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="6">Arrange the Canadian bacon slices in a row at the top of the baking sheet and lay spinach on top. </step>
    <step num="7">Place the chicken sausage patties in a row under the Canadian bacon and top with the American cheese slices. </step>
    <step num="8">Fold the bottom part half of the parchment paper over until you reach the patties to create a “barrier” between the meat toppings and the vegetarian toppings. </step>
    <step num="9">Place the vegetarian burgers on the bottom half of the baking sheet and top with the cheddar cheese. </step>
    <step num="10">Reduce the oven temperature to 350˚F (180˚C) and bake the toppings for 15-20 minutes, until the meat is warmed through and the cheese has melted. </step>
    <step num="11">On a cutting board, layer the sandwich starting with a pancake layer, followed by the egg layer. Arrange the bacon and other toppings in quadrants on the egg. Top the Canadian bacon and spinach with hollandaise sauce, if desired. Top with the second pancake layer. </step>
    <step num="12">Slice into 16 sandwiches and serve immediately, or wrap in parchment paper and freeze in an airtight container for up to 1 month and microwave on defrost for about 5 minutes, until it is warm. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
