  <steps>
    <step num="0">On a cutting board, peel the onions, and cut into ½-inch (1 ¼-cm) rings. Separate the rings. </step>
    <step num="1">Sort the onion rings into four cones, starting with a big ring and going up to a small one. </step>
    <step num="2">Place the flour, eggs, and panko in 3 separate medium bowls. </step>
    <step num="3">Dip an onion ring into the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip it into the eggs, then the panko, then back into the eggs, and into the panko again. </step>
    <step num="4">Place the onion ring on a greased, parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining onion rings, creating four stacked cones on the tray. Freeze the onions ring cones for 1-3 hours. </step>
    <step num="5">Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). </step>
    <step num="6">In a medium bowl, mix the ground beef, onion, garlic, Parmesan, panko, parsley, Worcestershire, egg, salt, and pepper with your hands until fully combined. </step>
    <step num="7">Take a baseball-size handful of the meat mixture and roll it into a ball. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining meat mixture, creating four meatballs total. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 18 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat until it reaches 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="10">Gently lower one frozen onion ring cone into the oil. Fry until golden brown all over, 2-4 minutes. </step>
    <step num="11">Remove the cone with a slotted spoon and transfer to a wire rack set over paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining onion ring cones. </step>
    <step num="12">Add 1 meatball to each onion ring cone. Top with marinara sauce, grated Parmesan cheese, and basil. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
