    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C. </step>
    <step num="1">Peel the skin from the apples and grate on the coarse side of a cheese grater. Set aside. (To prevent browning, place grated apples in a bowl and cover with lemon juice and water. Drain before adding to the batter.) </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk until foamy and pale. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the greek yogurt, honey, and vanilla, to the bowl and whisk until the mixture is thick and well combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Sprinkle on the rolled oats, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and the grated apple. </step>
    <step num="5">Use a spatula to fold the wet and dry ingredients together. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour in the almond milk and continue mixing until everything is well incorporated. </step>
    <step num="7">Using a medium ice cream scoop, portion the batter into 12 muffin tin cups lined with cupcake liners. </step>
    <step num="8">Top with your choice of toppings. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 35-40 minutes, until the muffins have set and just started to turn golden brown. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
