  <steps>
    <step num="0">Add cauliflower florets and salt to a bowl and microwave for 5-7 minutes, or until the florets become soft. </step>
    <step num="1">Add flour, cornstarch, paprika, cayenne pepper, 2 cloves of minced garlic, salt, ginger, and 1 teaspoon soy sauce to a bowl. Mix until well combined. </step>
    <step num="2">Add water to the bowl in small amounts until the batter is thick and smooth. Add the cauliflower and mix until fully coated. </step>
    <step num="3">Heat oil in a pot to 425°F (220°C). </step>
    <step num="4">Add the coated cauliflower florets and deep fry until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="5">Transfer the fried cauliflower to a paper towel-lined plate, and sprinkle with salt. </step>
    <step num="6">In a cup or small bowl, make the cornstarch slurry. Combine the water and cornstarch and mix until well combined. </step>
    <step num="7">In a large pan, heat oil and saute garlic on medium high heat. Add the green onions and saute for 2-3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="8">Add the bell peppers and sauté for 7 minutes, or until the peppers are soft. </step>
    <step num="9">Add the vinegar, chili sauce, tomato sauce, soy sauce, and crushed pepper flakes, and mix well. </step>
    <step num="10">Add small amounts of the cornstarch water to the mixture and stir until the water becomes translucent. Add as much as you’d like, depending on how much gravy you want, but only go up to ½ cup (120 ml) of water to 4 tablespoons of cornstarch for maximum flavor. </step>
    <step num="11">Add the fried cauliflower and gently stir to coat it with the gravy. Add salt to taste and stir. </step>
    <step num="12">Serve with rice and top with optional lemon juice. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
