  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large pot, sauté the diced red onion and minced garlic in 1 tablespoon of olive oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the water, green lentils, and salt to the large pot. Bring to a boil. </step>
    <step num="2">Cover with lid and simmer for 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">To make the caramelized onions, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over low heat and add the onion slices, stirring occasionally until completely soft, dark brown, and caramelized. </step>
    <step num="4">NOTE: This will take about 30 minutes. The onions should become very dark and tacky when finished. Stir often to avoid burning. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the rice, cumin, cinnamon, and bayleaf to the lentils. Stir. </step>
    <step num="6">Cook covered for about 15 minutes, or until rice is cooked. </step>
    <step num="7">Serve lentils and rice topped with the caramelized onions, chopped fresh parsley, lemon wedges, and Greek yogurt if desired. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
