  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">On a cutting board, slice chicken lengthwise into 1-inch (2 cm) thick slices. Take each slice of chicken and cut it in half lengthwise leaving about 1 inch (2 cm) uncut on one end of the strip. </step>
    <step num="2">Cut off part of the uncut end of the chicken so you do not have a thick spot in the middle of your longer chicken strip. </step>
    <step num="3">Place chicken strips in a bowl. Add ½ teaspoon salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and 3 tablespoons lemon juice and mix to combine. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer to the refrigerator. </step>
    <step num="5">On a cutting board, slice each piece of bacon lengthwise creating 12 strips in total. </step>
    <step num="6">Wrap the cut strip of bacon around the asparagus. </step>
    <step num="7">Wrap a marinated chicken strip around the bacon-wrapped asparagus. Repeat with remaining ingredients. </step>
    <step num="8">Place each bacon chicken asparagus twist on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="10">Turn up the heat to broil, and broil for 10 minutes. Flip the twists over, and broil for an additional ten minutes. </step>
    <step num="11">In a bowl add the Greek yogurt parsley, dill, ½ teaspoon salt, and 3 tablespoons lemon juice. Stir until well combined. </step>
    <step num="12">Remove bacon asparagus twists from baking sheet, and let cool. Serve with herb yogurt dipping sauce. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
