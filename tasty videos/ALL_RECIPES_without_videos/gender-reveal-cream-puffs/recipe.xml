  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large pot over medium heat, combine the milk, water, sugar, salt, and butter. Cook until the butter melts. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the flour, all at once, and using a flexible spatula, stir until combined. Continue to mix until the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan and forms into a ball. Remove the pot from the heat and let cool for 2-3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="3">Mix in the eggs, one by one, only adding the next once the previous is fully incorporated into the dough. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip or a zip-top bag with a corner snipped off. </step>
    <step num="5">Pipe the dough straight down onto the prepared baking sheet in 1-inch (2 cm) circles, leaving 1 inch (2 cm) of space between each one. You may need to use another baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="6">Use a wet finger to press down any peaks. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 25-30 minutes, until puffed and golden brown. </step>
    <step num="8">Let the puffs cool completely on a wire rack. </step>
    <step num="9">Make the filling: In a large bowl, use an electric hand mixer on high speed to beat the heavy cream until soft peaks form. </step>
    <step num="10">Pour in the condensed milk and continue to beat until stiff peaks form. Add the food coloring and beat to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="11">Transfer the cream to a piping bag with a pointed round tip or a zip-top bag with a corner snipped off. </step>
    <step num="12">Add the white chocolate to a medium microwave-safe bowl and microwave until melted, stirring every 30 seconds, about 2 minutes total. </step>
    <step num="13">Use a bamboo skewer to poke a hole in the top of each puff, then pipe in the pink or blue cream, filling each puff about ⅔ of the way. </step>
    <step num="14">Dip the tops of the filled cream puffs in the white chocolate and decorate with sprinkles, if desired. </step>
    <step num="15">Let cool on a wire rack until the chocolate sets. </step>
    <step num="16">Arrange the cream puffs in a tower, then serve. </step>
    <step num="17">Enjoy! </step>
