  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large pot, crisp the bacon on medium heat. </step>
    <step num="1">Drain excess grease so there’s about 3 tablespoons left in the pot. </step>
    <step num="2">Add in the chicken, season with half of the seasoned salt and pepper, and cook. </step>
    <step num="3">Once the chicken is nicely browned, remove it from the pan but leave the bacon. </step>
    <step num="4">Add in the onion and asparagus. Stir until the onions begin to become translucent. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the garlic and spinach. Stir until spinach is wilted. </step>
    <step num="6">Add in the sun-dried tomatoes and season with remaining salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="7">Pour milk over veggie and bacon mixture, and bring to a boil. Stir periodically so the bottom does not burn. </step>
    <step num="8">Once milk is bubbling, add pasta and stir frequently until pasta reaches your desired doneness (approximately 10 minutes at medium heat). </step>
    <step num="9">Stir in chicken and parmesan cheese and mix until cheese is melted. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
