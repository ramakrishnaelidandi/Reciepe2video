  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Heat the oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion and celery and cook for 5-6 minutes, until the onion is semi-translucent and the celery has softened a bit. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the apple and cook for an additional 4-5 minutes, until softened. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the salt, pepper, parsley, rosemary, thyme, and sage and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the herbs are fragrant. </step>
    <step num="4">Add in about a ¼ of the cubed bread and 1 cup (240 ml) of the vegetable broth. </step>
    <step num="5">Stir well until bread cubes cook down. Continue, alternating between adding bread and broth, until everything has cooked down but the stuffing is still slightly chunky. </step>
    <step num="6">Transfer to a large baking dish and cover with foil. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 10 minutes, then uncover and bake for another 10 minutes, until the top is golden brown. Serve warm. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
