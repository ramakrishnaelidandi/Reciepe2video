  <steps>
    <step num="0">Put a pot on a medium low heat and melt the butter with the condensed milk. </step>
    <step num="1">Stir in the cocoa powder and continue to stir for 10-15 minutes until the mixture begins to pull away from the edge of the pot. </step>
    <step num="2">It’s done when you run the spoon through the centre of the mixture and it takes a few seconds to combine again. </step>
    <step num="3">Spread the mixture onto a buttered plate and refrigerate for 2 hours. </step>
    <step num="4">When set, roll the mixture into small balls and coat them in the chocolate sprinkles, (you may need to apply a small amount of butter to your hands to help them from sticking). </step>
    <step num="5">Enjoy! </step>
