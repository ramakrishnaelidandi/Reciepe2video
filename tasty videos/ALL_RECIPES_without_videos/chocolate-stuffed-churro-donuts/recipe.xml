  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add butter, brown sugar, salt, and water, and bring to a boil. </step>
    <step num="1">As soon as the butter has fully melted and the mixture begins to boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and add in flour. </step>
    <step num="2">Using a wooden spoon, stir until the dough comes together to form a ball and there are no lumps. </step>
    <step num="3">Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes before proceeding to the next step (to prevent accidentally cooking the eggs). </step>
    <step num="4">Mix in the vanilla extract and add in the eggs, one at a time, being sure to fully incorporate each egg before adding the next. </step>
    <step num="5">Once all the eggs are incorporated, transfer it to a piping bag with a large star tip. </step>
    <step num="6">On a nonstick baking sheet, pipe the dough in circles leaving a hole in the center. </step>
    <step num="7">Place the chocolate chips in a ring and top with remaining dough, making sure there are no gaps in between each layer. </step>
    <step num="8">Transfer the tray to the freezer and freeze until solid, about 3 hours or overnight. </step>
    <step num="9">Heat oil in a deep pot to 350˚F (175˚C). </step>
    <step num="10">Remove the baking tray from the freezer and use a butter knife to release the churro donuts. Return any extras to the freezer while you wait to fry. </step>
    <step num="11">Fry the donuts in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan, until brown and the dough is cooked through. </step>
    <step num="12">Drain on a paper towel before rolling in cinnamon sugar. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
