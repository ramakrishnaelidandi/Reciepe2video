  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Crack twelve eggs, and separate the yolks and egg whites into separate bowls. </step>
    <step num="2">Spray a mini muffin tin with nonstick spray. Pour each yolk and egg white into its own mini muffin tin hole. </step>
    <step num="3">Place the tin into a baking dish with a tinfoil ring, wire wrack, or a towel to keep the muffin tin from touching the bottom of the baking dish directly (so the eggs steam gently in the oven and don’t turn brown). </step>
    <step num="4">Cover the eggs and the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil. Make sure the foil tents up so it doesn’t touch any of the eggs. </step>
    <step num="5">Lift one edge of the foil and pour in boiling water ⅓ way up the muffin tin and re-cover with foil. </step>
    <step num="6">Place the eggs in the oven for 13 minutes. Check to make sure the egg whites and yolks are both fully cooked. </step>
    <step num="7">Remove foil and muffin tin from baking dish and let cool. </step>
    <step num="8">With a thin knife, remove the egg yolks and egg whites from the tin. Set the egg whites aside. </step>
    <step num="9">In a bowl, combine the cooked egg yolks, Greek yogurt, relish, mustard, hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Mix with a fork until well combined. </step>
    <step num="10">Place the mixture in a piping bag with a desirable tip and pipe the yolk mixture onto the cooked egg whites. Sprinkle with paprika and chopped parsley. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
