  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a bowl, combine all the ingredients with a fork until smooth and evenly mixed. </step>
    <step num="1">Transfer to an 8x8 inch (20x20 cm) baking dish lined with parchment paper. Smooth the mixture out with a spatula so that it’s evenly spread in the dish. </step>
    <step num="2">Freeze until solid, at least one hour. </step>
    <step num="3">Working quickly, remove the solid mixture from the sheet and cut into 4-inch x 1-inch (10 cm x 3 cm) rectangles (there should be 16). </step>
    <step num="4">One by one, bread each stick by coating in flour, then dredging in egg and then bread crumbs. Dip once more in the egg, then once more in the bread crumbs, and transfer to a baking dish. </step>
    <step num="5">Heat the oil to 375˚F (190˚C). </step>
    <step num="6">Carefully lower about three or four of the coated sticks into the oil and fry for about 30 seconds, until golden brown. Continue this until all of the sticks are fried. </step>
    <step num="7">Serve warm with ranch dip. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
