  <steps>
    <step num="0">Cut each eggplant into about ½-inch (1-cm) thick round slices. </step>
    <step num="1">Arrange the slices in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with paper towels. </step>
    <step num="2">Sprinkle the eggplant with half of the coarse salt. Flip the slices over and sprinkle with the rest of the salt. </step>
    <step num="3">Put another baking sheet on top of the eggplant and place something heavy, like a cast-iron skillet, on the top baking sheet to help release moisture from the eggplant. Let sit for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Uncover the eggplant slices and pat dry with paper towels. Brush most of the salt from the eggplant with a paper towel, then transfer to a medium bowl. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="5">In a separate medium bowl, combine the flour, oregano, basil, garlic powder, and pepper. Mix well. </step>
    <step num="6">Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan until it reaches 375°F (190°C). </step>
    <step num="7">Coat each eggplant slice in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess flour. </step>
    <step num="8">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="9">Fry the eggplant in batches until golden brown on both sides, 2-3 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet and pat dry using more paper towels to absorb excess oil. </step>
    <step num="10">Pour about 1 cup (260 g) of marinara sauce into a 2½-quart (2 L) baking dish and spread evenly to cover the bottom of the dish. </step>
    <step num="11">Add about 8 eggplant slices (it’s okay if they overlap) and cover with ½ cup (130 g) of marinara. Sprinkle with a third of the fresh basil, then top with about a third of the shredded mozzarella and Parmesan. Repeat to make 2 more layers. Finish with the fresh mozzarella cheese and a final sprinkling of Parmesan. </step>
    <step num="12">Bake for 30 minutes, until the mozzarella is bubbling and golden brown. </step>
    <step num="13">Let cool for 10 minutes, then serve garnished with fresh basil. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
