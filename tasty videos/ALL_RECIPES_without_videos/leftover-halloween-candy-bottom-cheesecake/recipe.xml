  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Grease a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan with cooking spray. </step>
    <step num="1">Make the cookie base: Chop the candy into bite-size pieces, then transfer to a medium bowl and set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, whisk together the brown sugar and granulated sugar. Add the butter and cream with an electric hand mixer until fluffy. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the egg, vanilla, salt, and baking soda and mix with a rubber spatula to combine. </step>
    <step num="4">Fold in the flour just until smooth, then add the candy pieces and fold to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="5">Transfer the dough to the prepared springform pan and pat down in an even layer. Refrigerate until ready to use. </step>
    <step num="6">Make the cheesecake filling: In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese and sugar. Beat with an electric hand mixer until smooth. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the salt, vanilla, and eggs and beat to combine. </step>
    <step num="8">Pour the filling over the chilled base and smooth the top. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake 35-40 minutes, until the sides are golden but the center still jiggles slightly. Let cool to room temperature. </step>
    <step num="10">Drizzle chocolate syrup in a spiral pattern over the cheesecake. Using a toothpick, draw lines outward from the center to create a spiderweb pattern. </step>
    <step num="11">Un-mold the cheesecake, then slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
