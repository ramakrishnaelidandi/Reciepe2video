  <steps>
    <step num="0">Heat a pan over medium-high heat. Add the sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla, and milk, and whisk until smooth. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat. </step>
    <step num="1">Let the pan cool. </step>
    <step num="2">Line a loaf pan with plastic wrap, or use popsicle molds. Pour mixture into pan. </step>
    <step num="3">Freeze for about 5 hours, until firm enough to stick popsicle sticks in. Gently slide each popsicle stick into chocolate, leaving about 2 inches (5 cm) in between each stick. Continue with the next row. There should be about 8 sticks per row, 16 popsicle sticks total. </step>
    <step num="4">Continue to freeze for another 4 hours, until completely frozen. </step>
    <step num="5">Remove the loaf pan from the freezer, and pull the plastic wrap upward releasing the chocolate. You may need to use a spatula to help release chocolate from pan. </step>
    <step num="6">Slice and serve immediately. </step>
