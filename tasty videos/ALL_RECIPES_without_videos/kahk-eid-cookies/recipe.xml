  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, combine the flour, sesame seeds, sugar, cinnamon, yeast, and salt. Stir with a fork, then add the ghee and warm water and beat with an electric hand mixer until a soft, pliable dough forms. </step>
    <step num="1">Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="2">Meanwhile, make the pistachio honey filling: In a small pot over medium heat, melt the ghee, then add the flour and stir until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="3">Reduce the heat to low, add the sesame seeds and honey, and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Remove the pot from the heat, add the pistachios, and mix well to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="5">Let the filling cool for 10 minutes, then form into 24 small balls. </step>
    <step num="6">Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="7">Once the dough has rested, roll into 24 balls. </step>
    <step num="8">Press a ball of the pistachio filling into the center of a dough ball, then wrap in the dough and roll again into a ball that completely encases the filling. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Arrange the cookies on the prepared baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="9">Press the cookies lightly into a Mamoul tool, or make a crosshatch pattern using a fork. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake the cookies for 18–20 minutes or until the bottoms are golden brown. </step>
    <step num="11">Let the cookies cool on a wire rack. </step>
    <step num="12">When ready to serve, dust the cookies with powdered sugar. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
