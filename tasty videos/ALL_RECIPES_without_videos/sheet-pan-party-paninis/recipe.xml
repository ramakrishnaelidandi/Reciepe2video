  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Pour half of the melted butter onto a large sheet tray, brushing it across the entire surface. </step>
    <step num="2">Shingle 12 slices of the bread onto the sheet pan, making sure each slice overlaps and the bread reaches the edges. </step>
    <step num="3">Place any fillings you choose onto the bread. You can mix and match any flavor combos you prefer! </step>
    <step num="4">For the ham and cheese sandwich, place 2 slices of cheddar cheese on the bread, four slices of ham, and 2 more slices of cheddar cheese. </step>
    <step num="5">For the chicken-bacon-ranch sandwich, place the shredded Monterey Jack cheese, 3 bacon slices, grilled chicken slices, and ranch dressing on the bread. </step>
    <step num="6">For the roast beef and onion sandwich, sprinkle on the shredded cheddar cheese, sliced roast beef, and half of the sautéed onions. </step>
    <step num="7">For the cheesesteak sandwich, add the provolone cheese, grilled steak, sautéed onions, and sautéed peppers. </step>
    <step num="8">For the turkey-bacon-avocado sandwich, add the shredded mozzarella cheese, sliced turkey, 3 slices of bacon, and the avocado. </step>
    <step num="9">For the tomato basil mozzarella, add the sliced fresh mozzarella cheese, sun-dried tomato, 3 tomato slices, salt, pepper, and chopped basil. </step>
    <step num="10">After all your fillings are in place, shingle another 12 slices of bread on top of the fillings. </step>
    <step num="11">Brush the bread with the remaining melted butter. </step>
    <step num="12">Place a second sheet pan over all the sandwiches and press down. Place heavy objects that can withstand oven heat, such as heavy pots or pans, on top of the pan to press the sandwiches. </step>
    <step num="13">Bake the sheet pan for 20 minutes or until the fillings have warmed through. </step>
    <step num="14">Remove the heavy objects and the top sheet pan, and bake the pressed sandwiches for another 20 minutes or until the bread turns golden brown and crisps up. </step>
