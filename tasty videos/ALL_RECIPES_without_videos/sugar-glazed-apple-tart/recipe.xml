  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="1">For the dough, put the flour, butter, oil, sugar, and salt in a food processor and process for about 10 seconds. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the Tablespoon of ice water and process for another five or six seconds. </step>
    <step num="3">Remove from the bowl and form into a flat dough. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and then refrigerate for 20-30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Lightly flour a work surface and roll the ball of dough into a thin layer, around ¼ inch (6 ⅓ mm) thick. </step>
    <step num="5">Using a round cutter, or use a round bowl or lid as a guide and cut out into a nice round circle. Carefully transfer the dough to a large cookie sheet lined with a nonstick baking mat. </step>
    <step num="6">Arrange the apple slices, alternating them nicely on top of the dough. Sprinkle the apple with sugar and put butter cubes on top. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the fruit is soft and the dough nicely browned. </step>
    <step num="8">Some of the juice from the fruit will have leaked out onto the cookie sheet. Before it hardens and makes the disks stick to the sheet, lift the tart with a broad spatula and transfer them to a cooling rack or platter. </step>
    <step num="9">Serve lukewarm or at room temperature with ice cream (optional). </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
