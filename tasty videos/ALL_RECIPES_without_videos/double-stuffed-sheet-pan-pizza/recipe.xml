  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 450˚F (230˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">To a bowl or stand mixer, add the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let the yeast proof for 5-15 minutes in a warm place until it is bubbling. </step>
    <step num="2">Add in the flour and salt. Mix in the bowl until well combined and the dough comes together into a ball. </step>
    <step num="3">Dump the dough onto a floured surface and knead briefly to smooth out the dough and develop gluten. Form the dough into a ball and place into a new, large greased bowl. Cover with a towel and let rise for one hour or until doubled in size. </step>
    <step num="4">Remove the dough from the bowl, and cut 2-three ounce (85g) portions of the dough. Roll each portion out to a size slightly larger than a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="5">Place the first rolled dough rectangle onto the greased baking sheet. Sprinkle a thick layer of mozzarella cheese onto the dough, then place the second sheet of dough on top to cover the cheese. </step>
    <step num="6">Place string cheese into the edges of the dough, and fold the edges over the cheese, crimping the edges. </step>
    <step num="7">Brush the dough with olive oil, salt, and pepper to taste. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 20 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted inside. </step>
    <step num="9">Quickly top the stuffed bottom crust with sauce and any extra toppings or cheese you would like. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake until the toppings are heated through, and the cheese has started to brown 10-15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="11">Transfer the pizza to a cutting board, slice, and serve. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
