  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Make three vertical cuts from top to bottom of each puff pastry sheet. The cuts should be about 2.5-inches (6-cm) apart. Repeat horizontally to make 18 squares. </step>
    <step num="2">Brush a square pastry lightly with water then place another square on top of it. Cut off any uneven edges. Repeat with the remaining squares. </step>
    <step num="3">Place the square pairs about 1-inch apart on a baking sheet, and brush the top of each with the egg wash. </step>
    <step num="4">Bake for 20 minutes or until pastry is a pale golden color. Remove from oven and let cool. </step>
    <step num="5">In a large pan, combine olive oil, peppers, salt and pepper. Cook for 8 minutes or until the peppers have softened. </step>
    <step num="6">Cut a rectangle in the middle of each square puff pastry and push it down. Fill the inside of the puff with a thin layer of bacon, cheddar cheese, and peppers. Use a small spoon or utensil to push the layers down. Carefully crack an egg on top. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for an additional 20 minutes or until egg white is no longer translucent or runny. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve with pepper and chives. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
