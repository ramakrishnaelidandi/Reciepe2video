  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a food processor add the broccoli, 1 cup (110g) of Parmesan, 1 clove of garlic, 1 egg, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Pulse until mixture forms a dough like texture, about 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Place 1 tablespoon of the broccoli mixture and press into a well greased muffin tin. Form the mixture into a cup, making the bottom and sides ½-inches (1 cm) thick. </step>
    <step num="3">Bake for about 30 minutes until the edges are golden and crispy and the bottom is firm. </step>
    <step num="4">Cool the broccoli cups. Once cooled, remove from the muffin tin. </step>
    <step num="5">Heat the oven to broil. </step>
    <step num="6">Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onions and garlic and cook until softened. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the ground beef, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon, and stir until browned. </step>
    <step num="8">Add the sausage, breaking it apart with a spoon, and stir until browned. </step>
    <step num="9">Mix in 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan, salt, pepper, 3 tablespoons of the basil, and 2 tablespoons of the parsley, and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="10">Add the tomato sauce and the tomato paste. Continue stirring until the meat sauce is bubbling. Reduce heat to low, and cover the pot, simmering for 45 minutes. </step>
    <step num="11">Place about a ¼ cup (65 g) of the ragu in the broccoli Parmesan cups. Top with mozzarella cheese. </step>
    <step num="12">Broil for 2 minutes until cheese is melted. </step>
    <step num="13">Top with the rest of the basil. </step>
    <step num="14">Broccoli Parmesan Cups can be stored up to 3 days and can be reheated in the oven. </step>
