  <steps>
    <step num="0">Note: make your own pumpkin pie spice by mixing 2 tablespoons cinnamon, 1 tablespoon ginger, 1 tablespoon nutmeg, and ½ tablespoon cloves; use 2 teaspoons in the dough, and 3 tablespoons in the topping mixture. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, and salt. </step>
    <step num="2">In a separate bowl, mix together pumpkin puree, egg, and butter. </step>
    <step num="3">Pour wet mixture into dry mixture and stir together with rubber spatula until fully incorporated. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">Heat oil in a frying pan to 325˚F (160˚C). </step>
    <step num="5">While oil is heating, use your hands to shape and roll the pumpkin donut dough into balls. (Greasing your hands with oil will make this process much easier). </step>
    <step num="6">Fry the dough balls until golden brown, about 4-5 minutes. (For best results, fry only 3-4 at a time). </step>
    <step num="7">Drain them on a paper towel and immediately transfer to bowl of the pumpkin pie spice-sugar mix. Gently toss to coat. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
