  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC). </step>
    <step num="1">Take potatoes and poke them on all sides with a fork. Microwave for 2-3 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Coat a wooden skewer with oil and insert the skewer through the length of the potato. </step>
    <step num="3">Hold a sharp, thin knife at an angle and cut through the end of the potato until it hits the wooden skewer. Begin rotating the potato to cut down the length of it and form a spiral. </step>
    <step num="4">Gently fan out the potato down the length of the skewer, until you have an even gap between the slices forming the spiral. </step>
    <step num="5">Brush the potato with melted butter. </step>
    <step num="6">In a medium bowl, combine remaining ingredients. </step>
    <step num="7">Shovel the dry mixture all over the potato until it is entirely coated. </step>
    <step num="8">Rest the skewered potatoes over a baking pan so the skewers suspend the potato over the bottom of the pan. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until nicely browned. </step>
    <step num="10">Garnish with additional parmesan and parsley. </step>
    <step num="11">Allow to cool for 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
