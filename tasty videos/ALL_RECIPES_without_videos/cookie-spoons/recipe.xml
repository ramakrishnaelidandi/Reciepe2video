    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 325˚F (160˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Place the sugar cookie dough sheet on a lightly floured surface. </step>
    <step num="2">Sprinkle the flour over the dough and knead together. </step>
    <step num="3">Roll out the dough to a ¼-inch (6-mm) thick square. </step>
    <step num="4">Top with sprinkles and lightly roll out the dough again so the sprinkles become submerged in the dough. </step>
    <step num="5">Place a spoon on top of the dough and trace its shape with a paring knife. Reroll the dough as needed to cut out 8 spoons. </step>
    <step num="6">Arrange spoons upside-down on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Lightly grease with nonstick cooking spray. </step>
    <step num="7">Place each cookie spoon cutout on top of a spoon. Lightly press down to mold. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the cookie dough is light brown. </step>
    <step num="9">Cool for 10 minutes before carefully removing the cookies from the spoons. </step>
