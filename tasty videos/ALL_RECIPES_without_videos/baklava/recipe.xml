  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Make the syrup: In a small pot over medium high heat, combine the sugar, water, and lemon juice, and bring to a boil. Simmer until reduced to a syrupy consistency, 5-7 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. </step>
    <step num="2">Make the filling: In a food processor, combine the walnuts, sugar, and cinnamon. Process until very finely ground. </step>
    <step num="3">Assemble the baklava: On a flat surface, lay out a sheet of phyllo dough. Brush with melted butter. </step>
    <step num="4">Spoon some of the filling along the bottom edge of the phyllo sheet, leaving ½ inch (1 ¼ cm) space from the bottom, then roll up as tightly as you can. Transfer to a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining ingredients. You should be about to fit about 12 phyllo rolls per baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="5">Brush the tops of the rolls with butter, then use a knife to score the rolls diagonally where you will slice them after baking. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="7">Immediately after removing from the oven, brush the baklava with the syrup. Finish slicing, then serve. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
