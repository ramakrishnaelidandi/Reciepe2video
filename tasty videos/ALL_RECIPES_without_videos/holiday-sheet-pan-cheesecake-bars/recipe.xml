  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Make the crust: In a large bowl, mix together the crushed graham crackers and melted butter until the mixture resembles wet sand. </step>
    <step num="2">Pour onto a baking sheet and press into an even layer. Use a spatula to draw lines in the crust crosswise, dividing it into 4 even sections. Arrange the graham cracker quarters along the lines, then press down the crust around the crackers to secure. </step>
    <step num="3">Bake for 8 minutes until lightly browned. Let cool to room temperature. </step>
    <step num="4">Reduce the oven temperature to 225°F (105°C). </step>
    <step num="5">Make the filling: In a large bowl, use an electric hand mixer on medium speed to whip the cream cheese and sugar until slightly fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs, 1 at a time. </step>
    <step num="6">Mix in the sour cream and vanilla. Divide the filling evenly between 4 medium bowls. </step>
    <step num="7">In the first bowl, mix in the sweet potato puree, ¼ teaspoon of cinnamon, and the nutmeg. </step>
    <step num="8">In another bowl, whisk in the chocolate hazelnut spread. </step>
    <step num="9">In another bowl, whisk in ¼ teaspoon of cinnamon. </step>
    <step num="10">In the last bowl, mix in the pumpkin puree and the pumpkin pie spice. </step>
    <step num="11">Pour each flavored filling into a section of the crust and smooth with a spatula. </step>
    <step num="12">Scoop the apple pie filling over the cinnamon flavor and swirl into the filling with a skewer. </step>
    <step num="13">Drizzle the melted semi-sweet chocolate over the chocolate flavor and swirl into the filling with a skewer. </step>
    <step num="14">Sprinkle the chopped pecans over the pumpkin filling. </step>
    <step num="15">Bake for 1 hour, until cheesecake is set. Let cool in the oven with the door open. </step>
    <step num="16">Refrigerate overnight before slicing into wedges and serving. </step>
    <step num="17">Enjoy! </step>
