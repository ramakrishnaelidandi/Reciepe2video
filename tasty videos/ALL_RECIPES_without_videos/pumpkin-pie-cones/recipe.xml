  <steps>
    <step num="0">Shape squares of aluminum foil into cones by placing a finger in the center of the square, and folding up all the sides around it. You may use another square to wrap the cone up to create a smooth surface. Spray each cone well, and place on a baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="1">Slice the puff pastry into one-inch (2 ½cm) strips, and brush them with a little water to make them sticky. </step>
    <step num="2">Carefully coil the dough around each cone. Pinch off the tip to seal them. </step>
    <step num="3">Bake at 400˚F/ 204˚C for 15 minutes, or until the dough begins to tan, and the cone holds it’s shape. </step>
    <step num="4">While cones are baking, mix together pumpkin puree, sugar, evaporated milk, salt, pumpkin sauce, and eggs together. </step>
    <step num="5">Remove the foil, and place the cones upright in a small glass, or a popover pan. </step>
    <step num="6">Use a piping bag or spoon to fill the cones with pumpkin filling. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake again at 400˚F/204˚C for 30-45 minutes, or until the filling sets, and begins to darken. Bake time will vary depending on the size of you cones. </step>
    <step num="8">Allow the cones to cool for 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Top with whipped cream, or vanilla ice cream and pumpkin spice. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
