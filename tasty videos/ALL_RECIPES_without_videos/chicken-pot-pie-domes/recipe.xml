  <steps>
    <step num="0">Heat a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the oil and the chicken breast. Season with salt and ¼ teaspoon black pepper, and cook for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally until the chicken is cooked through. </step>
    <step num="1">Transfer the chicken to a medium bowl and return the pan to the stove. </step>
    <step num="2">Reduce the heat to medium and melt the butter in the pan. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the onion, carrot, and celery, cooking until the vegetables have softened and the onion is translucent, 8-10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Sprinkle in the flour, stirring well so there are no lumps. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the garlic, parsley and thyme, and cook for 2-3 minutes more, until fragrant. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour in the chicken broth and stir occasionally until the sauce has thickened, 3-5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Stir in the frozen peas and reserved chicken. </step>
    <step num="8">Season with salt and pepper, then pour in the heavy cream. </step>
    <step num="9">Stir to combine and cook until the peas have defrosted. Remove the pan from the heat. </step>
    <step num="10">Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) </step>
    <step num="11">Lightly flour a clean work surface. Lay out 1 pie crust and lightly brush the top with water. Place another pie crust on top and lightly dust with flour. </step>
    <step num="12">Using a rolling pin, gently roll out the dough in order to bind the 2 crusts, taking care not to make them thinner. </step>
    <step num="13">Place a 5-inch (12 cm) metal bowl in the center of the crust and cut out a circle 2 inches (5 cm) larger than the bowl. </step>
    <step num="14">Place the cut-out dough circle inside the bowl, making sure to fully press down so the dough is flush against the surface of the bowl. </step>
    <step num="15">Fill the bowl with ¼ of the chicken mixture. </step>
    <step num="16">Roll the excess pie dough into a large circle. Cover the filled bowl with the dough circle slightly larger than the diameter of the bowl. </step>
    <step num="17">Press the edges of the dough together, then use scissors to trim any excess dough. Crimp the edges to close. </step>
    <step num="18">Repeat with the remaining pie crusts to make 3 more bowls. </step>
    <step num="19">Arrange the bowls on a baking sheet. Use a small knife to make small slits in the top crusts. </step>
    <step num="20">Bake for about 45 minutes, until the tops are a deep golden brown. </step>
    <step num="21">Let cool until the bowls are cool enough to handle. </step>
    <step num="22">To serve, place a plate on top of a pie, then invert onto the plate. Garnish with parsley. </step>
    <step num="23">Enjoy! </step>
