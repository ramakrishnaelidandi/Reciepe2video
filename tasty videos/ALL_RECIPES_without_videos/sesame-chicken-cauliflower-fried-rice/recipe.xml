  <steps>
    <step num="0">Remove all leaves and cut the cauliflower into small florets. </step>
    <step num="1">Place the florets in a food processor and blend until they are a rice-like texture. Be careful not to over process or it may turn mushy. Set aside, and drain excess moisture with a towel, if desired. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, cook the chicken until no pink is showing. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the peas, carrots, soy sauce, and black pepper. </step>
    <step num="4">Stir until most of the liquid has reduced, then add the cauliflower rice. Cook for about 3-4 minutes until the vegetables and chicken are incorporated evenly into the cauliflower. </step>
    <step num="5">Spread the rice towards the edge of the pan, creating a well in the center. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour the beaten eggs into the well, stirring only the eggs until they are cooked. </step>
    <step num="7">Fold the eggs into the rice, then mix in the sesame seeds. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
