  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350째F (180째C). </step>
    <step num="1">Prepare your favorite plain vanilla cake recipe or use a prepared box and follow its instructions. </step>
    <step num="2">Using the back of a wooden spoon, poke at least 3 rows of 4 holes in the cooked cake, making 12 holes total. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large bowl, mash the strawberries with a potato masher or fork until mashed to a pulp. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the cream cheese and condensed milk, whisking until there are no large lumps. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the mashed blackberries and raspberries; stir just once or twice so the colors remain differentiated. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour the mixture over the cake and let settle into the holes for about 10 minutes. Some of the mixture will still stay on top, which is okay. </step>
    <step num="7">Spread the whipped topping evenly over the cake. Sprinkle graham crackers on top and add sliced strawberries or other fresh berries. </step>
    <step num="8">Chill the cake for at least 3 hours or up to overnight. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
