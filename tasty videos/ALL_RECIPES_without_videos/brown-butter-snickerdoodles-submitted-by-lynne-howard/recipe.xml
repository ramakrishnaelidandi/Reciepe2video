  <steps>
    <step num="0">Whisk together the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, ½ teaspoon cinnamon, and salt in a bowl and set aside. </step>
    <step num="1">Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. The butter will begin to foam. Make sure you whisk consistently during this process. After a couple of minutes, the butter will begin to brown on the bottom of the saucepan; continue to whisk and remove from heat as soon as the butter begins to brown and give off a nutty aroma. </step>
    <step num="2">Immediately transfer the butter to a bowl to prevent burning. Set aside to cool for a few minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">With an electric mixer, mix the butter and sugars until thoroughly blended. </step>
    <step num="4">Beat in the egg, yolk, vanilla, and yogurt until combined. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the dry ingredients slowly and beat on low-speed just until combined. </step>
    <step num="6">Chill your dough for 3 hours or as long as possible in the refrigerator (important!). </step>
    <step num="7">NOTE: You can place it in the freezer for 30 minutes if you are super eager, although I cannot promise the same results if you do this. Fridge is always best! You want the dough VERY cold. If you desire a 'puffy' cookie, place them in the fridge overnight. </step>
    <step num="8">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="9">Once dough is chilled measure about 2 tablespoons of dough and roll into a ball. </step>
    <step num="10">Meanwhile mix the rolling mixture in a bowl. </step>
    <step num="11">Roll balls in cinnamon-sugar mixture. Place dough balls on cookie sheet, 2 inches (5 cm) apart. </step>
    <step num="12">Bake the cookies 8-11 minutes or until the edges of the cookies begin to turn golden brown. They will look a bit underdone in the middle, but will continue to cook once out of the oven. Bake longer if you like crispier cookies. </step>
    <step num="13">Cool the cookies on the sheets at least 2 minutes. Remove the cooled cookies from the baking sheets after a few minutes and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. </step>
    <step num="14">Repeat with remaining dough. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
