  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 425˚F (220˚C) </step>
    <step num="1">On a baking sheet, place the 4 potatoes. Using a fork, puncture holes all around the potatoes. Bake for 1 hour until the potato gives when you press into it. </step>
    <step num="2">In a bowl, add the chicken, salt, pepper, half of the scallions, ½ cup (50 grams) mozzarella, and ranch. Stir to combine and set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">Once the potatoes have cooled place one on a cutting board. Cut the potato in half lengthwise. Cut off one of the ends of the potato. Using a spoon, scoop out the insides of the potato making sure not to scoop out too much or the potato skin will be too thin. With the remaining potatoes, cut them in half lengthwise and cut off both of the ends and scoop out the potato. </step>
    <step num="4">On a parchment paper-lined baking sheet place both ends. Place three of the skins alongside one potato end and place the other 3 potato skins alongside the other end </step>
    <step num="5">Brush the potato skins with the rest of the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="6">Scoop the chicken mixture into the potato skins and press down into an even layer. Sprinkle the rest of the mozzarella cheese over the potato skins. Bake for 5 minutes until melted. </step>
    <step num="7">Top with bacon and the rest of the scallions. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
