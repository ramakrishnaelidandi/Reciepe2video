    <step num="0">NOTE: If you have unroasted nuts, preheat oven to 350째F (180째C). Spread peanuts onto a baking tray and bake for 10-12 minutes or until you can smell them. </step>
    <step num="1">In a food processor, blend peanuts. Scrape down the sides when necessary. </step>
    <step num="2">When the peanuts have broken down and become crumbly, add in honey and salt while still blending. </step>
    <step num="3">The mixture will turn into a ball and eventually even out. </step>
    <step num="4">Slowly add canola oil while still blending. Add more canola oil if you want a creamier texture. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour into a jar, store in a refrigerator and use within one month. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
