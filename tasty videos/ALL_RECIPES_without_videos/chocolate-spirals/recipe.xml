    <step num="0">Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch by 14-inch (30 cm by 35 cm) rectangle. </step>
    <step num="1">Use a spatula to spread the chocolate hazelnut spread over half of the pastry. Fold other half of the pastry over the chocolate spread. </step>
    <step num="2">Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). Grease a baking sheet with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="3">Slice lengthwise into twelve ½-inch (1 cm) wide strips. </step>

    <step num="5">Transfer the spirals to the prepared baking sheet and brush with egg wash. </step>
