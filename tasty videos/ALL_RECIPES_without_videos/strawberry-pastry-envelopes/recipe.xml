  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400째F (200째C). </step>
    <step num="1">Unroll pie crusts and cut in half. Cut out a 5-inch-wide (12-cm) square in each half. Rotate the squares to resemble diamond shapes. </step>
    <step num="2">Use leftover pie crust to cut out 4 small hearts with a heart-shaped cookie cutter. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">Fold four sheets of aluminum foil into small rectangles. Using your finger, slightly open the inside of each rectangle. </step>
    <step num="4">Place the foil packets in the center of each pie crust diamond. </step>
    <step num="5">Dip your finger with water and wet the edges of the left, bottom, and right flaps. </step>
    <step num="6">Apply cooking spray to the tops of the aluminum foil packets. </step>
    <step num="7">Following the folds of a real envelope, close the flaps over the foil, leaving the upper flap open. </step>
    <step num="8">Wet one side of the pastry hearts and arrange them wet side down onto the folded edges of the pastry envelopes. </step>
    <step num="9">Place pastries onto parchment paper-lined baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="10">Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with sparkling sugar. </step>
    <step num="11">Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown. Place a piece of aluminum foil over the top flaps of the envelopes if they begin to brown before the rest of the envelope. </step>
    <step num="12">Cool completely before stuffing with strawberry slices. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
