  <steps>
    <step num="0">Brush melted butter on the inside surfaces of the hamburger bun and place on a pan or griddle on low heat. </step>
    <step num="1">While the bun is toasting, flatten each beef patty so that it’s about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick. </step>
    <step num="2">Place the cheese in the middle of one of the patties, then cover it with the other patty. </step>
    <step num="3">Push the patties together and pinch the edges, assuring there are no holes for the cheese to seep through. </step>
    <step num="4">Place meat on a griddle or pan over medium high heat. Cook 5-10 minutes per side or until cheesy juices start spilling out. </step>
    <step num="5">Add pickles to the bottom half of the bun, followed by the onions. Then top it off with the cooked burger and top bun. </step>
    <step num="6">Get your chompers ready! But be careful - the cheese is super hot inside! </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
