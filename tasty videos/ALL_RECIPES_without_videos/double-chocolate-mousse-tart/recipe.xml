  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the crust: In a medium bowl, use a fork to combine the graham cracker crumbs and the butter until they are the texture of wet sand. </step>
    <step num="1">Transfer the crust to an 8-inch (20 cm) springform pan and use the bottom of a wine glass or other flat instrument to press against the bottom. </step>
    <step num="2">Make the dark chocolate mousse: In a medium bowl, let the melted dark chocolate chips cool to room temperature, then use a spatula to gently fold in whipped cream. </step>
    <step num="3">Pour the dark chocolate mousse over the crust and smooth out the top as much as possible, then freeze for 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Make the milk chocolate mousse: In a medium bowl, let the melted milk chocolate chips cool to room temperature, then use a spatula to gently fold in whipped cream. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour the milk chocolate mousse over the dark chocolate layer and smooth the top with a spatula. </step>
    <step num="6">Freeze for 2 hours, or until the mousse is set. </step>
    <step num="7">Take a vegetable peeler and press it down along the edge of the chocolate bar to create mini chocolate spirals. Make at least 2 tablespoons worth. </step>
    <step num="8">Remove from the cake from the freezer and gently take the cake out of the springform pan. </step>
    <step num="9">Sift the cocoa powder over the top of the cake, then sprinkle with the chocolate shavings. </step>
    <step num="10">Pairs well with Cabernet Sauvignon. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
