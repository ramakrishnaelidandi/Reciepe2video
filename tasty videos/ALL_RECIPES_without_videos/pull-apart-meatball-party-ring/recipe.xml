  <steps>
    <step num="0">Sprinkle flour onto a clean work surface. Lay out the puff pastry sheets next to each other and sprinkle more flour onto a rolling pin. Roll out the pastry, connecting the 2 sheets, until you have a 20x15-inch (50x30-cm) rectangle about ⅛-inch (3 mm) thick. </step>
    <step num="1">Use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut the puff pastry into 32 even squares. </step>
    <step num="2">Dollop a teaspoon of marinara sauce on top of each pastry square. </step>
    <step num="3">Place a pre-cooked meatball in the middle of each square. </step>
    <step num="4">Wrap the puff pastry dough around each meatball to form balls. </step>
    <step num="5">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="6">In a medium bowl, combine the butter, garlic, and parsley. </step>
    <step num="7">Place half of the pastry meatballs into a bundt pan. </step>
    <step num="8">Brush the tops of the balls with garlic butter and sprinkle with half of the mozzarella cheese. Add the rest of the meatballs on top, brush with garlic butter, and finish with the rest of the cheese. Reserve the remaining garlic butter. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 40 minutes. </step>
    <step num="10">Brush the balls at the top of the pan with garlic butter, then invert the meatball ring onto a wire rack-lined baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="11">Brush the top of the ring with more garlic butter. </step>
    <step num="12">Sprinkle mozzarella on top of the ring. </step>
    <step num="13">Bake for another 20 minutes until pastry is lightly golden brown. </step>
    <step num="14">Brush the surface of the ring with leftover butter mixture. </step>
    <step num="15">Transfer to a serving platter and place a small bowl of marinara sauce in the middle of the monkey bread. </step>
