  <steps>
    <step num="0">Crush cheese puffs into a fine powder and set aside. </step>
    <step num="1">In a saucepan over medium heat, add the butter. Once the butter is melted, add milk, cheddar, mozzarella, and cream cheese. Whisk until all the cheese has melted and sauce is smooth. </step>
    <step num="2">Pour cheese sauce over cooked pasta, stirring to ensure thorough coverage of the noodles. </step>
    <step num="3">Cover and refrigerate the cheese-coated pasta for at least 2 hours, allowing for it to cool completely and for the cheese sauce to bind the pasta together. This recipe also works well with leftover mac ‘n’ cheese. </step>
    <step num="4">Using your hands, take the chilled mac ‘n’ cheese and form it into 1-inch (2 ½ cm) balls. </step>
    <step num="5">Dredge the balls in flour, followed by egg before finally coating them in the powdered cheese puffs. </step>
    <step num="6">Heat the oil to 350˚F (180˚C) and fry the mac ‘n’ cheese balls until the outside is crispy, about 2 minutes. Once done frying, transfer to a wire rack to drain. Lightly sprinkle with salt before serving. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
