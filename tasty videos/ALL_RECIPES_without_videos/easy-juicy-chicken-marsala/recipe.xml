  <steps>
    <step num="0">Cut each chicken breast in half crosswise, then cut the larger half again horizontally, creating 3 cutlets. </step>
    <step num="1">Place the flour, salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder into a wide shallow dish and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour mixture, shaking gently to remove any extra flour and set aside. </step>
    <step num="3">Heat oil and 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken in batches to prevent overcrowding. </step>

    <step num="5">In the same pan, add more oil or butter as needed. </step>
    <step num="6">Add garlic, shallots, and the cremini mushrooms to the pan, stirring occasionally and scraping bottom the bottom of the pan until the mushrooms are soft and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes. </step>

    <step num="8">Add the chicken stock and lemon juice, and allow mixture to come to a boil. </step>

    <step num="10">Remove the pan from the One Top and add 2 tablespoons of cold butter and stir until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Return the pan to the One Top and then add the cooked chicken to the sauce, let simmer for 5 more minutes. Make sure to flip the chicken halfway through. </step>
    <step num="11">Sprinkle with parsley and serve with pasta, potatoes, or rice. </step>
