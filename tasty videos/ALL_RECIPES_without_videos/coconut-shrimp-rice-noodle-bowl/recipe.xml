  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a small bowl, stir together the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. </step>
    <step num="1">Place the shrimp on a cutting board and pat dry with paper towels. Season the shrimp on both sides with the spice mixture. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the flour, eggs, and panko to 3 separate shallow bowls. Add the coconut flakes to the bread crumbs and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="3">Dredge the shrimp in the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip the floured shrimp in the beaten egg, then into the panko mixture. Transfer the breaded shrimp to a baking sheet until ready to fry. </step>
    <step num="4">Heat 3 inches (7 ½ cm) of canola oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat until it reaches 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="5">Working in batches, fry the shrimp in the hot oil until golden brown on both sides, 2-3 minutes, turning halfway through. Transfer the shrimp to a wire rack to drain. </step>
    <step num="6">In a large bowl, whisk together the lime juice, lime zest, sesame oil, brown sugar, and Sriracha. Using tongs, toss the rice noodles in the sauce until fully coated. </step>
    <step num="7">Divide the noodles between 4 bowls. Top with the carrot ribbons, avocado, coconut shrimp, cucumber, basil, mint, cilantro, and scallions. Sprinkle with black sesame seeds, if using. </step>
