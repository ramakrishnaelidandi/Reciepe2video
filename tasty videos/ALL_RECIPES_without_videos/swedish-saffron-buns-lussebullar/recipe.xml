  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a small saucepan, combine the milk, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and the saffron threads. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Once the milk is steaming, remove from the heat and let cool to 110˚F (43˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Sprinkle the yeast over the milk and let bubble, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, remaining sugar, salt, and cardamom. </step>
    <step num="3">Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the milk, 2 eggs, sour cream, and butter. Stir to combine, then, once the dough starts to come together, use your hands to incorporate fully. </step>
    <step num="4">Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and knead until the dough is springy, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Place the dough in a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size. </step>
    <step num="6">Punch down the dough and flip onto a clean surface. </step>
    <step num="7">Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Form each piece into a ball about 2 inches (5 cm) wide, then roll into a cylinder about 12-14 inches (30 cm) long </step>
    <step num="8">Swirl the dough into a S shape starting at one end until the middle and then the other end. </step>
    <step num="9">Transfer the dough to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for 30 minutes, until doubled in size. </step>
    <step num="10">Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="11">Beat the remaining egg and brush over the dough swirls. Place a single raisin or chocolate chip in the center of the swirls on each end. </step>
    <step num="12">Bake the buns for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
