  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, add the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda and whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium bowl or liquid measuring cup, add the buttermilk, melted butter, and egg yolks and whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the buttermilk mixture to the dry ingredients and gently fold with a rubber spatula until just combined. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the egg whites and fold until just combined. Be sure not to overmix. Some lumps are okay. </step>
    <step num="4">Let the batter rest for 15-30 minutes at room temperature. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the butter to a cast iron skillet and heat over medium low heat. Once the butter has melted and is bubbling, reduce the heat to medium-low and add ⅓ cup (75 g) of batter to the pan. </step>
    <step num="6">Cook for 2-3 minutes, until bubbles start to appear on the surface. If adding any toppings like chocolate chips or blueberries, sprinkle over the pancake. Flip the pancake over and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown. Repeat with the remaining batter. </step>
    <step num="7">Serve the pancakes with butter and maple syrup. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
