  <steps>
    <step num="0">Add the dark chocolate into the heated heavy cream. Mix both together until the chocolate fully melts forming a chocolate ganache. </step>
    <step num="1">Pour the ganache into mason jar lid rings that are laying on a parchment paper-lined sheet tray. Freeze the chocolate ganache for at least 15 minutes to firm up. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, add the egg yolks, sugar, and melted butter, whisk until smooth. Add in the milk, whisk again. Then sift in the flour, baking powder and salt. </step>
    <step num="3">Whisk the dry ingredients into the wet until as smooth as possible. Small lumps are perfectly fine. </step>
    <step num="4">Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form and then fold them into the pancake batter until just combined. </step>
    <step num="5">In a small skillet, melt butter until bubbling and then add your pancake batter. Take chocolate ganache disc straight from the freezer and place on top of the batter and press in down to the center. Put another layer of batter over the top. </step>
    <step num="6">Cover the skillet with a lid and let the pancakes cook on low heat for 20-30 minutes or until the top has full set. Then flip the pancake and cook the other side for 2 minutes on medium heat to color the other side. </step>
    <step num="7">Serve with butter, maple syrup, powdered sugar, or berries (optional). </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
