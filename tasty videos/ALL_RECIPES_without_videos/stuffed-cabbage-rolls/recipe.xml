  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a medium pan over medium heat, heat the olive oil until shimmering, then cook the garlic until fragrant, for 1-2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Stir in the crushed tomato, paprika, chili powder, ground cumin, salt, and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. </step>
    <step num="2">In a medium bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, pepper, chili powder, cumin, oregano, rice, and 1 cup (260 G) of tomato sauce. Mix until combined. Refrigerate until ready to use. </step>
    <step num="3">Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add the cabbage, cut side down. Cover with a lid, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer for 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) for 45 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Transfer the cabbage to a cutting board, cut side up, and let cool until it reaches room temperature. </step>
    <step num="6">Peel off a layer of the cabbage. With the stem facing upwards, use a paring knife to trim the thicker stem, which will make the leaf easier to roll. With the stem side pointed towards you, place a few tablespoons of filling at the base of the leaf. </step>
    <step num="7">Roll upwards so the filling is covered by a single layer of the cabbage. Fold both sides in, then roll all the way up. </step>
    <step num="8">Place the cabbage roll seam side down in a 9x13-inch (23x33 -cm) baking dish and repeat with the remaining filling. </step>
    <step num="9">Spoon the remaining tomato sauce over the cabbage rolls. </step>
    <step num="10">Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake for 45 minutes. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
