  <steps>
    <step num="0">Whisk the heavy cream, condensed milk, and salt in a bowl. </step>
    <step num="1">Pour the mixture over a half sheet pan, or multiple quarter sheet pans. Make sure the ice cream base just barely covers the bottom. It should be ¼-inch (1 cm) thick or less. </step>
    <step num="2">Sprinkle any chopped-up toppings you would like. With a whisk, mix the toppings into the ice cream base to ensure they’re evenly distributed. </step>
    <step num="3">Freeze for at least 4 hours. Make sure to also put your scrapers and ice cream bowls in the freezer so the ice cream doesn’t melt while rolling. </step>
    <step num="4">After the ice cream is frozen solid, remove from the freezer and quickly place the metal spatula/paint scraper at an 45° angle against the edge of the pan, pushing carefully forward. If the ice cream needs a little help forming, use a butter knife to push the sheet of cream into the roll. </step>
    <step num="5">Place the rolled ice cream in a chilled bowl and top with any toppings you desire. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
