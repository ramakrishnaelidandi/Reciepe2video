    <step num="2">Pour the batter into an 8-inch (20-cm) springform pan and smooth the top with a spatula or knife. </step>
    <step num="3">Bake for 25 minutes. Remove from oven and use a spatula to press down the top. Let cool to room temperature. </step>
    <step num="4">Make the peanut butter mousse: in a small bowl combine the gelatin and water, and set aside. </step>
    <step num="5">In a large bowl, mix the peanut butter and powdered sugar until smooth and shiny. </step>
    <step num="6">Microwave the gelatin mix for 10 seconds, then mix into the peanut butter until thick and lumpy. Gently fold in half the whipped cream. Once incorporated, fold in the remaining whipped cream. </step>
