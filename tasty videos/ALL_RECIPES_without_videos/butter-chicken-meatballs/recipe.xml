  <steps>
    <step num="0">Meatballs: In a medium bowl, stir together bread crumbs and milk. Let sit for 5 minutes. Add in garlic, egg, salt, and pepper, then stir until well-combined. Stir in ground chicken. Combine well, but do not overmix. With oiled hands, roll the meat into golf-size balls. </step>
    <step num="1">Pour 1 tablespoon vegetable oil into a skillet over medium heat. Add meatballs and brown on all sides. Remove meatballs from the pan (meatballs will not be fully cooked through at this time). Wipe the pan out to make the sauce. </step>
    <step num="2">Sauce: Heat vegetable oil and butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger, then let sizzle for a minute or two. </step>
    <step num="3">Let the sauce cool for 5–10 minutes. Blend sauce until smooth, adding a tablespoon or two of water if it is too thick to blend. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour the sauce back into the skillet. Whisk in the butter, cream, and 1 teaspoon garam masala. Add the meatballs to the sauce and stir to coat. Cover and cook for 5 minutes, or until meatballs are fully cooked through. </step>
    <step num="5">Garnish with cilantro. Serve with rice and lime wedges. </step>
    <step num="6">Enjoy! </step>
