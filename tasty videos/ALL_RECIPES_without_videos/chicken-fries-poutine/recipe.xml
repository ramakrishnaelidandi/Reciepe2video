  <steps>
    <step num="0">Slice the chicken into thin strips, about ½-inch (1 ¼ cm) wide, so that they resemble fries. Season generously with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium bowl, mix together the white pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and salt. Add the flour and mix until well combined. </step>
    <step num="2">In a separate medium bowl, beat the eggs. Add the panko to another medium bowl. </step>
    <step num="3">Dredge the chicken strips in the flour-spice mixture, then dip in the egg, then the panko, pressing the bread crumbs onto the chicken to ensure even coverage. </step>
    <step num="4">Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet. Shallow-fry the chicken fries for 1–2 minutes on each side, until fully cooked and golden. Drain on paper towels. </step>
    <step num="5">Arrange half of the chicken fries on a platter or baking dish, then top with half of the cheese curds and a bit of the gravy. Top with the rest of the chicken fries, the remaining cheese curds, and gravy. Garnish with chives and serve immediately. </step>
