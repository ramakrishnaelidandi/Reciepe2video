  <steps>
    <step num="0">Bring a medium saucepan filled with water to a boil. Add the cashews and boil for 30 minutes, then drain. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the boiled cashews, non-dairy yogurt starter, xanthan gum, and water to a blender. Blend until smooth. </step>
    <step num="2">Transfer the “cheese” mixture to a large bowl, cover with a kitchen towel, and let sit at room temperature, or between 72º-90ºF (22˚-32˚C), for 12-16 hours. </step>
    <step num="3">Return the mixture to the blender. Add the salt, apple cider vinegar, agar agar flakes, tapioca starch, and coconut oil. Blend until smooth. </step>
    <step num="4">Fill a large bowl with water and salt generously. Stir to dissolve the salt, then add ice. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="5">Transfer the “cheese” mixture to a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir constantly until the mixture begins to pull together, 3-5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Using an ice cream scoop, scoop golf ball to baseball-size pieces of the mixture into the ice water. Allow the “mozzarella” balls to sit for 30 minutes, until they have firmed up and become stretchy. </step>
    <step num="7">Store in salt water in the fridge for up to 1 week. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
