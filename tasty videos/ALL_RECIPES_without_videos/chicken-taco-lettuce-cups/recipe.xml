  <steps>
    <step num="0">Place the chicken breasts, salt, peppercorns, onion, whole garlic cloves, bay leaves, and water in a large pot. </step>
    <step num="1">Cover the pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. </step>
    <step num="2">Once the water is simmering, cook for 10 minutes, until the chicken registers 165°F (74°C) when pierced with an instant-read thermometer. </step>
    <step num="3">Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and reserve at least ¾ cup (180 ml) of the cooking liquid to use as broth. Using 2 forks, pull the chicken apart until shredded. </step>
    <step num="4">In a large nonstick pan, heat the oil over medium heat until shimmering. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the minced garlic, cumin, paprika, chili powder, and oregano. Sauté until the oil is bubbling and very fragrant, about 2 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the chicken broth and stir until the liquid has reduced and thickened slightly, about 7 minutes. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the shredded chicken and mix until everything is well incorporated. </step>
