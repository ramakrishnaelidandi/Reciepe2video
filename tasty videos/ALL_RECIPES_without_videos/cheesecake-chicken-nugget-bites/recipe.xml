    <step num="0">Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt until smooth. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a round tip or a zip-top bag with a corner snipped off and set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and cinnamon. </step>
    <step num="3">Pour the graham cracker crumbs evenly over the prepared baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="4">Pipe the cream cheese mixture into 8 “chicken” nuggets directly onto the graham cracker crumbs. Use a spoon to gently cover the nuggets completely with the crumbs, then cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and freeze for 2 hours. </step>
    <step num="5">In a small bowl, combine the raspberry preserves and chocolate syrup to make “barbecue sauce”. </step>
    <step num="6">Gently brush any excess crumbs off the nuggets, then serve with the sauce. </step>
