  <steps>
    <step num="0">Start by activating the yeast. Add yeast and malt syrup to warm water, stir until dissolved. Once the yeast mix starts bubbling, you'll know the yeast is active. </step>
    <step num="1">Combine the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Add the activated yeast mix and form a loose dough in the bowl. </step>
    <step num="2">Turn dough out onto your surface and knead until everything comes together nicely. (If it’s too dry, add more water a little bit at a time.) Transfer dough to an oiled bowl, cover and let the dough rest for 45 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">While the dough is resting, prep your cream cheese. Freeze cream cheese into 1 tbsp. balls. </step>
    <step num="4">Punch down dough after 45 minutes, knead the dough a few times. Pull a handful of dough, form into a ball then flatten and wrap around a frozen cream cheese ball. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Place bagel balls on a parchment paper, cover and let it rest for 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">While the bagel balls are resting, bring your poaching liquid ingredients to a boil over medium heat. </step>
    <step num="6">Take the rested bagel balls and boil in the poaching liquid for 15-20 seconds. Remove and place on parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="7">Brush with egg wash and sprinkle desired bagel toppings. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake in 325°F (160°C) preheated oven for 20 - 30 minutes until top is golden brown. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
