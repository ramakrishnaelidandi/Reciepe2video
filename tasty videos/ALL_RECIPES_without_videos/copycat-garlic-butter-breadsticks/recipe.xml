  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the warm water to a large bowl with the melted butter, sugar and yeast. Stir to help the yeast dissolve and let the mixture sit for 5 minutes, or until it becomes foamy on top. </step>
    <step num="2">Add in the flour and salt (optional) to the yeast mixture. Use a mixing spoon to incorporate the wet and dry ingredients until it comes together into a sticky ball. </step>
    <step num="3">Cover the dough with a towel and place in a warm part of your kitchen. Let rise for 1½ hours, or until it doubles in size. </step>
    <step num="4">Remove the risen dough from the bowl and knead on the counter with extra flour until the dough becomes smooth on the surface and no longer sticky. </step>
    <step num="5">With a rolling pin, flatten the dough until it’s about a 7x12 inch (18x30 cm) rectangle, and slice into 12 strips. If you don’t have a rolling pin, you can cut the dough into 12 portions and roll each into 7 inch (18 cm) logs with your hands. </step>
    <step num="6">Place the dough on parchment paper-lined baking sheets with cooking spray. </step>
    <step num="7">Brush melted butter and sprinkle garlic salt on the dough. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake the breadsticks for 15 minutes or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="9">When the breadsticks come out of the oven, serve immediately, or cool and store in the freezer for up to 6 months to eat at a later date. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
