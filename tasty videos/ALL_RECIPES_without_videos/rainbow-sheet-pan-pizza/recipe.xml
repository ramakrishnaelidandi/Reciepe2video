  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a small bowl, combine half of the warm water and the brown sugar. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the active dry yeast and let foam without stirring for about 8 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, combine the pureed beets, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, salt, 2 cups (250 g) of flour, and the yeast mixture. </step>
    <step num="3">Rinse the yeast mixture bowl with the remaining warm water to get all the yeast, and pour into the large bowl. </step>
    <step num="4">Mix with your hands and gradually add in the reamining flour until the dough comes together in a ball and is not moist to the touch. </step>
    <step num="5">Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, until it becomes smooth and bouncy and does not stick to the surface. Add flour as needed. </step>
    <step num="6">Pour the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a clean large bowl and rub around with your fingers. </step>
    <step num="7">Place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with the oil. </step>
    <step num="8">Cover with a kitchen towel or a plastic wrap and let rise for at least 1 hour at room temperature (preferably warm). The dough should double in size. </step>
    <step num="9">Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C). </step>
    <step num="10">Grease a nonstick baking sheet with the olive oil. </step>

    <step num="12">Save one dough half for later. It will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks in a bowl covered tightly with plastic wrap. </step>
    <step num="13">Using a rolling pin, flatten the remaining ball of dough into a rectangular shape that will approximately fit on the baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="14">Transfer the dough to baking sheet and stretch as needed to cover the pan. </step>
    <step num="15">Leaving a 1-inch (2 cm) border all around the sides, spread the pizza sauce over the dough and sprinkle with mozzarella. </step>
    <step num="16">Add strips of cherry tomatoes, orange bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, spinach, and roasted purple sweet potatoes. </step>
    <step num="17">Season with salt, pepper, and oregano. </step>
