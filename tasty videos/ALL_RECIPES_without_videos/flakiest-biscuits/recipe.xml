  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. </step>
    <step num="2">Using your hands or a pastry cutter, incorporate the butter into the dry ingredients, leaving large chunks. </step>
    <step num="3">Fold in the buttermilk until a thick dough forms. </step>
    <step num="4">Lightly flour a clean surface and dump the dough onto it. Bring the dough together until it comes together in one large piece. </step>
    <step num="5">Roll out with a rolling pin to about 1 ½-2 inches (4-5 cm) thick. Using a biscuit cutter or small glass, cut out 2-3-inch (5-7 cm) rounds and place them on the prepared baking sheet. It’s okay if the biscuits are touching. </step>

    <step num="7">Brush the biscuits with melted butter. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve as desired. </step>
