  <steps>
    <step num="0">Divide pizza dough into 12-14 equal sized balls. With floured hands, roll the dough balls into logs and tie into individual knots, tucking the excess underneath. </step>
    <step num="1">Coat a 10 inch (25 cm) oven-safe skillet with olive oil. </step>
    <step num="2">Place the knots in a ring around the skillet. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes, allowing the dough to reach room temperature. </step>
    <step num="3">In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, mozzarella, parmesan, ricotta, fresh basil, 3 cloves of garlic (chopped), and red pepper flakes. </step>
    <step num="4">Melt the butter and add the fresh parsley and remaining garlic. Stir well. </step>
    <step num="5">Uncover the knots and scoop the dip into the center of the skillet. Brush the knots with the butter/garlic mixture (reserving some for after baking), and top the dip with an additional sprinkle of cheese (optional). </step>
    <step num="6">Bake in a preheated oven (400˚F/200˚C) for 20 minutes. Broil on high for two additional minutes or until knots and cheese are lightly browned, watching closely so as not to burn it. </step>
    <step num="7">Remove from oven and brush lightly with additional garlic butter. </step>
    <step num="8">Let cool slightly before serving. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
