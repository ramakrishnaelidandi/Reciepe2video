  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with a reusable baking mat or parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">Arrange poblanos on the prepared baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes, turning occasionally, until the skins begin to turn brown and pull away from the flesh. </step>
    <step num="2">Meanwhile, make the filling: Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the red onion, season with salt, and sauté for 3 minutes, until beginning to soften. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute, until fragrant. Add the cumin, coriander, and cayenne and stir to coat the vegetables with the spices. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the quinoa, beans, corn, tomato sauce, and lime juice and season with salt. Stir to combine, then cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the chopped cilantro. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the roasted poblanos to a bowl and cover with a plate or plastic wrap. Steam for 15 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C). </step>
    <step num="6">Peel the skins off the poblanos. Leaving the stem intact, cut a slit lengthwise down each pepper to form a pouch. With a small spoon, carefully remove the seeds. The poblano flesh will be delicate—it’s fine if it tears a bit. </step>
    <step num="7">Lay the peeled poblanos side by side in a greased 9-x13-inch (22 cm x 33 cm) baking dish. Stuff each pepper with about ½ cup of the filling. Top each pepper with 2 tablespoons of Monterey Jack cheese. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake the stuffed peppers for 15-20 minutes, until the filling is completely warmed through and the cheese is melted and beginning to brown. </step>
    <step num="9">Serve the peppers garnished with cilantro leaves and serve with avocado slices and lime wedges. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
