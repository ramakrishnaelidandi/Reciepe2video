  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, combine flour, eggs, butter, and sugar, stirring until ingredients are slightly mixed. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the milk ½ cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring vigorously, making sure the milk is completely incorporated into the batter and that the batter is smooth before adding more milk. </step>
    <step num="2">Repeat with the rest of the milk. The batter should be very liquidy and have no lumps. </step>
    <step num="3">In a pan over medium heat, pour ⅓ cup (95 grams) of the batter in the center and swirl the batter around the edges of the pan until set. </step>
    <step num="4">To know when the crepe is ready to flip, lift up one of the edges about ⅓ of the way. The bottom side should be golden brown. Flip the crepe. </step>
    <step num="5">Cook until the edges are starting to slightly crisp. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove from heat and cover with a paper towel to make sure the crepes stay moist. </step>
    <step num="7">In a pan over medium heat, mix the brown sugar and butter until slightly bubbling. </step>
    <step num="8">Add the cinnamon and bananas, stirring until bananas are evenly coated with the caramel. </step>
    <step num="9">Remove from heat and cool. </step>
    <step num="10">Spread half of the banana mixture on half of one crepe. </step>
    <step num="11">Fold the other half of the crepe on top of the bananas, then fold the crepe in half. </step>
    <step num="12">Repeat with the other crepe. </step>
    <step num="13">Serve with whipped cream and a drizzle of caramel sauce. </step>
