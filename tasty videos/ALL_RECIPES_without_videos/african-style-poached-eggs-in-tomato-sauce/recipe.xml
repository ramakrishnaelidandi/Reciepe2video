  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the garlic and onions, cooking until the onions are translucent and the garlic is starting to slightly brown. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the spices and harissa paste, cooking the spices until fragrant, about 1 minute. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the tomatoes and tomato paste and cook for about 10-15 minutes until the sauce has thickened to the point where pressing down with a spoon leaves an indent that holds its shape. </step>
    <step num="4">Taking the back of a large spoon, make 5 large indents into the sauce, using a left-to-right wiggling motion to ensure that the “walls” of the sauce are tall enough to hold an egg. </step>
    <step num="5">Crack the eggs into each of the indents, then cook over low heat for about 15-20 minutes until the eggs are cooked to your liking. </step>
    <step num="6">NOTE: To speed the process up, cover the skillet with a large lid. </step>
    <step num="7">Sprinkle with chopped parsley, remove from heat, and serve with crusty bread to mop up all the sauce. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
