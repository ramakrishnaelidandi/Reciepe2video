  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat your oven to 350ºF (180ºC). </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium bowl, mix 1 package of the brownie mix, half of the oil, half of the water, and one egg until just combined. </step>
    <step num="2">Pour the mix into a half sheet pan lined with parchment paper, and spread with a spatula until even. </step>
    <step num="3">Repeat with the other brownie mix and bake for 13 to 15 minutes, until the brownies are fudgy yet firm, and let cool. </step>
    <step num="4">Once cool, cut one pan of the brownies into 4 rectangular shapes, 8 triangular shapes, and one circle. </step>
    <step num="5">Line a large glass mixing bowl with plastic wrap and fit the brownies into it like a puzzle, placing the circular one on the bottom and working around it. </step>
    <step num="6">Once the inside is covered, press down firmly on all the brownies until the outer shell forms. Make sure there are no openings in the outer layer. </step>
    <step num="7">Scoop the strawberry ice cream onto the brownie shell and smooth with a spatula. </step>
    <step num="8">Cover with plastic wrap and press a smaller bowl into the ice cream. Freeze for 3 hours, until the strawberry layer is solid. </step>
    <step num="9">Unwrap and repeat with the vanilla ice cream, covering it well and pressing the smallest bowl into it and freezing for two hours. </step>
    <step num="10">While freezing, cut a circle into the other pan of brownies the circumference of the large bowl. </step>
    <step num="11">Uncover the now frozen vanilla layer, fill the divot with chocolate ice cream, and cover with the cut circle of brownie. Eat the brownie leftovers or save for another bombe! </step>
    <step num="12">Press the circle to secure it and freeze the completed bombe for one hour. </step>
    <step num="13">Carefully remove the bombe from the freezer and flip it over onto a cutting board or serving platter. It may need to thaw a couple minutes before it dislodges from the bowl. </step>
    <step num="14">Once you can lift the bowl up easily, uncover the dome-shaped bombe and dust with cocoa powder. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
