  <steps>
    <step num="0">Add the sugar and cornstarch to a large saucepan and whisk until combined. Stir in the water and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat, whisking until the sugar has dissolved, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until a thick syrup forms and turns golden, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the cherries and cook for another 2-3 minutes until syrup has thickened. Turn off the heat and stir in the almond extract. Set aside to cool. </step>
    <step num="2">Line an 8-inch (20 cm) springform pan with plastic wrap. Transfer the cherry filling to the pan and spread evenly. Freeze for 2-3 hours, until firm. </step>
    <step num="3">Combine the crushed cookies with the melted butter in a medium bowl until well-combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the cookie crumb mixture to a 10-inch (25 cm) springform pan. Use a spatula or measuring cup to press the cookie crumbs down to form an even base. Freeze for 10 minutes. </step>

    <step num="10">Chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours before slicing and serving. </step>
