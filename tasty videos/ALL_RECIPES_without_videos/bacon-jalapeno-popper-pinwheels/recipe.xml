  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C) and cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">In a pan, cook bacon until crisp, then chop into small pieces. </step>
    <step num="2">Discard excess fat (reserve approximately 2 tablespoons). </step>
    <step num="3">In the same pan, sauté the onions in the reserved fat until they start to become translucent. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the jalapeños. Cook until the onions start to caramelize and remove from heat. </step>
    <step num="5">In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese, bacon, cheddar, pepper, garlic powder, and jalapeño mixture. Stir until thoroughly incorporated. </step>
    <step num="6">On a lightly floured surface, gently roll out the puff pastry until the surface is smooth and even. </step>
    <step num="7">Spread the japapeño mixture on the pastry sheet, stopping 1 inch (2 ½ cm) from the top of the dough. </step>
    <step num="8">Starting at the bottom, tightly roll upwards and pinch the top edge to seal into a log shape. </step>
    <step num="9">Cut the roll every 1½ inches (3 ¾ cm). Place the pieces face-up, 2 inches (5 cm) apart on the baking sheet. Sprinkle the tops of the pastries with cheddar. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the sides of the pastries are a light golden color. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
