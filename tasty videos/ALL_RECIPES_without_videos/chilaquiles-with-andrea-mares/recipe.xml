  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a small pot, combine the guajillos, anchos, chiles de árbol, halved tomato, and water. Bring to a boil over [level] heat. Cover cover and cook for 10 minutes, or until the peppers are rehydrated and softened. </step>
    <step num="1">Using a slotted spoon, transfer the peppers and tomato to a blender. Add the onion, garlic, salt, and about ½ cup (60 g) of the pepper cooking liquid. Blend until smooth, adding more liquid as needed if the sauce is too thick. </step>
    <step num="2">Cut the corn tortillas into triangles. Add to a cast iron with around 2 cups (480 ml) of heated oil. </step>
    <step num="3">Fry the tortilla triangles until golden and crispy. Leaving the chips in the pan, remove all but 2 tablespoons of the hot oil. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the eggs to the pan and stir around with the chips. Once the eggs are almost set, pour in the chile sauce and stir until well-combined. </step>
    <step num="5">Top the chilaquiles with queso fresco, red onion, avocado, and cilantro. </step>
    <step num="6">Serve immediately. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
