  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the pie dough: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cinnamon, and salt. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut shortening into the flour until the shortening breaks down into pea-sized pieces. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and stir gentle until the dough starts to come together. </step>
    <step num="2">Dump the dough onto a work surface lined with 2 large pieces of plastic wrap. Shape dough into a disc and wrap tightly with the plastic wrap. Chill the dough in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C) </step>
    <step num="4">Make the filling: In a small bowl, mix together the sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt. </step>
    <step num="5">In a large bowl, whisk the eggs. Add the pumpkin and sugar-spice mix and whisk to combine. Slowly whisk in the evaporated milk until incorporated. </step>
    <step num="6">Once the dough has chilled, lightly flour a clean surface. Roll out the dough to a ¼-inch (6 mm)-thick round. Keep the surface and rolling pin floured as needed so the dough doesn’t stick. Transfer the dough to a 9½-inch pie pan (24 cm). Tuck the edges under and crimp. Note: The key to flaky pie crust is to handle it as little and as gently as possible. Handle it only as much as is absolutely necessary to mix, shape, and roll out. </step>
    <step num="7">Pour the filling into the pie shell. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake the pie for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350˚F (180˚C) and bake for another 40 minutes, or until the center jiggles slightly. </step>
    <step num="9">Cool the pie on a wire rack for 2 hours. </step>
    <step num="10">Slice and serve with whipped cream or ice cream. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
