  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Add flour, sugar, cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder to a large mixing bowl and whisk to thoroughly incorporate, making sure there are no lumps. </step>
    <step num="2">Once, the dry ingredients are thoroughly mixed together, create a small well in the middle and add in the coconut oil, maple syrup, and almond milk. Continue to whisk until a thick and lumpy batter forms. </step>
    <step num="3">Grease the inside of two 9-inch (23 cm) cake tins with coconut oil or nonstick baking spray, and add about 1 teaspoon of cocoa powder to dust the inside of the pan. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour half of the batter into each of the cake tins. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake them for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. </step>
    <step num="6">Once cakes are finished, transfer them or a cooking rack for 5-10 minutes before removing the finished cakes from their tins. </step>
    <step num="7">While the cakes cool prepare the frosting. Add vegan butter, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract to a mixing bowl and whisk using an electric hand-mixer until a smooth and glossy frosting forms. </step>
    <step num="8">Add almond milk and continue to mix until incorporated. </step>
    <step num="9">Choose which of the cakes will be the bottom of your finished cake and carefully level it off. </step>
    <step num="10">Place a small amount of the icing in the middle of your serving dish and place the cake on top. </step>
    <step num="11">Using about a cup (about 115g) of the icing, generously coat the bottom layer of the cake using a spatula. </step>
    <step num="12">Once the icing is spread out evenly, place the second cake on top and continue to frost the cake using the rest of the icing. </step>
    <step num="13">Refrigerate the cake for 30 minutes before serving. </step>
    <step num="14">Slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="15">Enjoy! </step>
