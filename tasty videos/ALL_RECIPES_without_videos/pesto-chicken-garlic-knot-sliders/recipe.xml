  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Cut pizza dough into eighths. (Each ball of dough should yield 8 even-sized pieces of dough, for a total of 16). </step>
    <step num="2">Using your hands, roll each piece of dough into a thin strip about 7 inches (18cm) long. Then carefully tie them into a knot, tucking the loose ends of dough underneath. </step>
    <step num="3">Place each tied knot on a baking sheet or casserole dish with high sides, nestling them close together in a 4x4 grid. Once all the knots are placed in the dish, cover and let rest for 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Uncover and bake for 12 minutes or until the slider buns are golden brown and no doughy grey bits remain. </step>
    <step num="5">Once the knots are out of the oven, lower the oven temperature to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="6">Allow the knots to cool, carefully remove them from the baking dish and cut the grid horizontally,creating both a top and bottom piece. </step>
    <step num="7">NOTE: It’s helpful to hold the knots together with a towel on top while cutting them horizontally, as the motion of the knife might cause some of them to pull apart. </step>
    <step num="8">Return the bottom half of the knot-grid to the original baking dish. Evenly layer the bread with cooked chicken, followed by the pesto and mozzarella cheese. Place the top half of the garlic knots on top. </step>
    <step num="9">Mix together melted butter, garlic, and parsley. Brush mixture liberally over the top of the knots. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake at 350˚F (180˚C) for an additional 10 minutes until the tops of the knots are golden brown and cheese is melted. </step>
    <step num="11">Pull apart for individual sliders. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
