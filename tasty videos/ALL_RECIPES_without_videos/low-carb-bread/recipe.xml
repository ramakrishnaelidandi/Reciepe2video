    <step num="2">Place the 2 whole eggs in the large bowl with the yolks and add the oil. 4. Beat together with a fork or whisk until smooth. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the almond flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt to the egg yolk mixture. Stir the mixture with a spatula until well incorporated and set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the cream of tartar to the egg whites and beat with a hand mixer until stiff peaks form. </step>

    <step num="6">Add the next ⅓ of the whites to the batter and fold in until smooth. </step>
    <step num="7">Gently fold in the remaining egg whites just until the batter is smooth and no white streaks remain. </step>
    <step num="8">Line the bottom of an ungreased loaf pan with parchment paper and pour in the batter. </step>
