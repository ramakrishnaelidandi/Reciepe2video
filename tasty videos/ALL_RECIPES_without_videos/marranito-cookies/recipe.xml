  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the piloncillo and water to a small saucepan over medium heat and cook for 10 minutes, until the sugar is completely dissolved and big brown bubbles form. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. </step>
    <step num="2">Sift the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon into a large bowl. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the butter and mash into the flour with a fork until combined. Add the orange zest and stir to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="4">Push the dry ingredients to the sides of the bowl to make a well. Add the vanilla, 1 egg, and cooled piloncillo syrup to the center. Using a fork, slowly mix the dry ingredients into the center until everything is evenly combined. </step>
    <step num="5">Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Lightly flour a clean surface and roll out the dough to a rectangle about ¼ inch (6 ½ mm) thick. Re-roll any dough scraps and cut out more cookies. </step>
    <step num="7">Using a 2½-inch (6 ½ cm) pig cookie cutter, cut out cookies and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="8">Beat the remaining egg, then brush over the cookies. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 8–10 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Let the cookies cool before serving. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
