  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a food processor, pulse the mushrooms and onions until broken into uniformly fine pieces, about 10 pulses, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. </step>
    <step num="1">Heat the oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. </step>
    <step num="2">Pour the mushrooms and onions into the skillet and season with salt and pepper. Sauté until the veggies have released moisture and softened, about 8 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the garlic and oregano. Sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. </step>
    <step num="4">Push the veggies to the sides of the pan and add the tomato paste, slowly mixing in the veggies from the side until a uniform paste has formed. </step>
    <step num="5">Add the crushed tomatoes and stir until well combined and thick. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the vegetable stock and stir until the sauce has thickened slightly. Reduce the heat to medium-low if it is bubbling and popping too much. </step>
    <step num="7">While the sauce simmers, place the chickpeas in the food processor and pulse until broken into fine pieces, about 10 pulses. </step>
    <step num="8">Pour the chickpeas into a fine mesh strainer and submerge in a medium bowl filled with water. </step>
    <step num="9">Shake the strainer for 1 minute to remove starches from the chickpeas. You’ll know when to remove the strainer when the water has become very cloudy from the starches. </step>
    <step num="10">Transfer the chickpeas to the sauce and stir for at least 1 minute to give the chickpeas time to cook. </step>
    <step num="11">Use the sauce as desired for pasta, veggie noodles, calzones, etc.. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
