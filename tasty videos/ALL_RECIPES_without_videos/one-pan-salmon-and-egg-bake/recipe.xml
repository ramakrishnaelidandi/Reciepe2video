  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Pour oil into a small, oven-safe skillet. Place the spinach and garlic in the skillet, season with a pinch of salt and pepper, and mix well so that everything is evenly coated. </step>
    <step num="2">Place the salmon on 1 side of the pan, then form a well on the other side and crack an egg, making sure it stays intact. </step>
    <step num="3">Season the tops of the salmon and the egg with another pinch of salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="4">Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the salmon reaches an internal temperature of 140°F (60°C). (The temperature will continue to rise once it rests out of the oven.) </step>
    <step num="5">Squeeze a bit of fresh lemon juice over the salmon fillet for more flavor and let the salmon rest for 5 minutes before serving. </step>
    <step num="6">NOTE: If you want a runny egg yolk, follow steps 1-3, then place the skillet in the preheated oven. Halfway through the cooking process (about 10 minutes in), crack a cold egg into the well of the spinach and replace the skillet in the oven for another 10-15 minutes. The salmon will be cooked through, the egg white will show color, and the yolk will be gloriously runny. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
