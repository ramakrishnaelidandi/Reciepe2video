  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">Roast the squash: Add the butternut squash to the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with the olive oil and season with the salt and pepper. Toss to coat. </step>
    <step num="2">Bake for 30 minutes, until the squash is tender and starting to brown around the edges. </step>
    <step num="3">Make the dough: Transfer the squash to a large bowl and mash until smooth. </step>
    <step num="4">In a separate large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, yeast, salt, ginger, sage, olive oil, and maple syrup. </step>
    <step num="5">Stir with a wooden spoon until well mixed. Add 1 cup (450 g) of the mashed butternut squash (save the rest for another use) and work with your hands until the dough begins to come together. </step>
    <step num="6">Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. </step>
    <step num="7">Place the dough in a bowl, cover with a kitchen towel, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1-2 hours. </step>
    <step num="8">Make the maple olive oil: In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, maple syrup, and salt. </step>
    <step num="9">Once the dough has risen, roll out to about a 20-inch (51-cm) wide circle. Brush with maple olive oil and sprinkle with the chopped sage. </step>
    <step num="10">Cut the dough into about 1½-inch (4-cm) squares. Roll up each dough square like a jelly roll. </step>
    <step num="11">Place the dough pieces in a greased 8½x4½-inch (21x11-cm) loaf pan with the cut sides up. </step>
    <step num="12">Loosely cover the loaf pan with a kitchen towel and let rise for 45 minutes. </step>
    <step num="13">Towards the end of proofing, preheat the oven to 350°F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="14">Lightly brush the top of the proofed loaf with maple olive oil and garnish with the whole sage leaves. </step>
    <step num="15">Bake for 35 minutes, until golden brown. If the top begins to brown too quickly, loosely cover with foil for the remainder of the cook time. </step>
    <step num="16">Let the bread cool for 15 minutes before serving. </step>
    <step num="17">Enjoy! </step>
