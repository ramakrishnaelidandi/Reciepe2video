  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease a 9x5-inch (23x13-cm) loaf pan with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="1">Cut the cauliflower into florets and add to a food processor. Pulse until the cauliflower reaches a “rice”-like consistency. You should have 3-4 cups. (900 g) </step>
    <step num="2">Transfer the riced cauliflower to a large microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 4 minutes to steam the cauliflower and release its liquid. Let sit until cool enough to handle. </step>
    <step num="3">Transfer the riced cauliflower to a bowl lined with cheesecloth or a tea towel. Tightly wrap the cauliflower and squeeze out all of the liquid, until it is dry and crumbles between your fingers. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">Separate the yolks and whites of the eggs into two large bowls. Beat the whites with an electric hand mixer until stiff peaks form. </step>
    <step num="5">Add about ¼ of the beaten whites to the bowl of yolks. Then, add the almond flour, Parmesan, if using, garlic, baking powder, butter, and salt. Gently mix with a rubber spatula until combined. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the remaining egg whites, dried cauliflower, and Italian seasoning. Gently fold the ingredients together until just combined. Do not overmix, as this will break down the egg whites. </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer the mixture to the prepared loaf pan and sprinkle the top with sesame seeds, parsley, and rosemary. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown. </step>
    <step num="9">Let cool, then slice and serve as desired. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
