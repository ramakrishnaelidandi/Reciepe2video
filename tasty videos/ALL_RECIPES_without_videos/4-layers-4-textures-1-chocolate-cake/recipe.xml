  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Line an 8-inch (20-cm) square baking pan with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, 3 tablespoons of granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder, and 6 tablespoons of melted butter until fully incorporated and the mixture looks rich and chocolaty. </step>
    <step num="2">Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking pan and pack down to cover the bottom of the pan in an even layer. </step>
    <step num="3">Bake for 10 minutes, then let cool. </step>
    <step num="4">Reduce the oven temperature to 325˚F (160˚C). </step>
    <step num="5">Separate the eggs into two large bowls. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the remaining ¾ cup of granulated sugar to the egg yolks and whisk until pale yellow. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the remaining ½ cup of melted butter and the vanilla and mix until fully incorporated. </step>
    <step num="8">Sift in the flour and ⅓ cup (40 g) of cocoa powder and mix thoroughly. </step>
    <step num="9">Slowly add the milk, stirring continuously, until a very wet batter forms. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="10">Beat the egg whites with an electric hand mixer until frothy. Add the cream of tartar and continue beating until medium peaks form. Whisk ⅓ of the egg whites into the egg yolk batter, then gently fold in the remaining egg whites with a rubber spatula. </step>
    <step num="11">Pour the batter over the graham cracker crust and bake for 40 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center jiggles slightly. Let cool for at least 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="12">In a large bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form and the cream has doubled in volume. </step>
    <step num="13">Sift in the remaining 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder and the powdered sugar and fold with a rubber spatula to incorporate. </step>
    <step num="14">Invert the cooled cake onto a cutting board. Remove the parchment paper and flip the cake again so the graham cracker crust is on the bottom. </step>
    <step num="15">Spread the chocolate whipped cream onto the cake. </step>
    <step num="16">Slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="17">Enjoy! </step>
