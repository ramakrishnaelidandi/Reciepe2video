  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">On a cutting board, peel potatoes then cut each in half widthwise. </step>
    <step num="2">Using a melon ball scooper or a metal teaspoon hollow out the potato starting from the cut side, once you have most of the potato hollowed out from that side create a smaller hole on the rounded side and continue hollowing until you can see through the potato. </step>
    <step num="3">Place potatoes in water to avoid discoloration while you finish hollowing out the rest. </step>
    <step num="4">Place potatoes with the smaller hole facing up on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="5">Wrap one piece of bacon and each potato, tucking in the end of the bacon so it stays in place. You might need to use a toothpick to hold the bacon in place. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 45 minutes, or until bacon reaches desired crispiness. </step>
    <step num="7">Allow potatoes to cool slightly then press cheddar cheese into the bottom of the potato. </step>
    <step num="8">Crack an egg over the top hole of the potato being careful not to let too much of the egg white pour over the side. </step>
    <step num="9">Sprinkle chives over the egg. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake for 6 to 12 minutes depending on how well done you would like your eggs. </step>
    <step num="11">Let cool before serving. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
