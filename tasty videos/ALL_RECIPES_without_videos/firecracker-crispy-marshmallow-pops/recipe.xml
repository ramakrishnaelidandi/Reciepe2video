  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large glass bowl, melt the marshmallows and butter in the microwave for 3 minutes. Stir to fully incorporate. </step>
    <step num="1">Mix in the puffed rice cereal and stir until evenly coated. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the fizzy rock candy and stir until well combined. Be sure to add the candy no sooner than this stage, for it may lose its “pop” if mixed with the hot marshmallow mixture. </step>
    <step num="3">Spread the mixture in a 9x9-inch (23x23-cm) pan lined with parchment paper and press down to create an even layer. Top with fizzy rock candy. </step>
    <step num="4">Dip 9 straws sticks in a bit of melted white chocolate and place them in 3 even rows across the baking tin. </step>
    <step num="5">Let the white chocolate harden at room temperature for 30 minutes or in the refrigerator for 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove the parchment paper and cut into 9 equal squares. </step>
    <step num="7">Dip the treats into melted milk chocolate going half way up, and decorate with sprinkles and more rock candy. </step>
    <step num="8">Place the completed pops on a parchment paper-lined sheet tray and let sit for about an hour until the chocolate is set. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
