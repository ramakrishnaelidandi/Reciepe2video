  <steps>
    <step num="0">Carefully slice the pack of dinner rolls in half, being sure to keep the rolls connected as a single units as they are split into tops and bottoms. </step>
    <step num="1">Remove the top and place the bottom section in a 9x12 inch (23x30 cm) baking dish. </step>
    <step num="2">Sprinkle the bottom with about 1 cup (100 g) of the shredded mozzarella cheese (make sure it is evenly coated as this will act as a barrier between the sauce and the bread, preventing the rolls from getting soggy). </step>
    <step num="3">Top the cheese with the shredded rotisserie chicken. Drizzle the hot sauce and ranch dressing evenly over the chicken and spread out evenly with a spoon. Top with remaining mozzarella cheese. </step>
    <step num="4">Place the top half of the rolls on top and brush evenly with melted butter. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake in a preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, until the cheese is melty and the rolls have heated through. </step>
    <step num="6">Remove from oven, cool slightly before transferring to a cutting board. </step>
    <step num="7">Using a large knife, follow the lines of the rolls, cutting them into 12 individual sliders. </step>
    <step num="8">Enjoy! </step>
