    <step num="3">In a third bowl, add the bread crumbs, garlic powder, cumin, and paprika, and whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="4">Halve the avocados, cutting from the stem to the base. </step>
    <step num="5">Remove and discard the pits. Cut each half into ½ inch (1 ¼ cm) wide slices then remove and discard the skin. </step>
