  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Roll out the puff pastry into a square shape and brush the surface with egg wash. </step>
    <step num="2">Cut the puff pastry sheet into 6 equal rectangles. </step>
    <step num="3">Place a hot dog on the bottom of each pastry rectangle, then roll it up tightly. </step>
    <step num="4">Slice each rolled hot dog into 3 equal segments. </step>
    <step num="5">Repeat with the remaining puff pastry and hot dogs. </step>
    <step num="6">In a large springform pan, place a circular wall of the hot dog pieces around the circumference of the edge. Stack a second row of rolled hot dogs on top, so that they go up the entire side of the pan. </step>
    <step num="7">Build a 3-way wall with more hot dogs that all meet in the center to create 3 holes for the dips. </step>
    <step num="8">Carefully place each dip into each open space, spreading them out evenly and making sure the walls don’t move. </step>
    <step num="9">Cover with foil and bake for 1 hour and 45 minutes. </step>
    <step num="10">Remove the foil and bake uncovered for another 30 minutes until the pastry is crispy. </step>
    <step num="11">Cool until warm to the touch. Unclasp the springform pan. </step>
    <step num="12">Enjoy! </step>
