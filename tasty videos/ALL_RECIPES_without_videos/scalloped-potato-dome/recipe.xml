  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Using a mandolin, slice the red potatoes to about 3 millimeter-thick slices. </step>
    <step num="2">Slice the gold potatoes to about 5-6 millimeters thick. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large bowl, combine the red potatoes with the salt, pepper, and heavy cream, and stir until evenly coated. </step>
    <step num="4">Butter an oven-safe, 8 or 9-inch, stainless steel mixing bowl. </step>
    <step num="5">Starting from the center, lay the red potatoes in an overlapping, circular fashion, making sure they make good contact and are sticking to the bowl. Repeat the circular pattern up until roughly ½-inch from the top of the bowl. </step>
    <step num="6">Place the sliced gold potatoes into the cream, stirring until fully coated with cream. </step>
    <step num="7">Shake off the excess cream, then layer the potato slices at the bottom of the bowl, building in a similar circular fashion. </step>
    <step num="8">After 2-3 rotations, place down 2 slices of cheddar. To fill the gaps, you might need to cut 2 more slices into halves and use those strips near the edges. </step>
    <step num="9">Layer another 2 rotations of gold potatoes. </step>
    <step num="10">Place the strips of bacon in a single layer across the potatoes. </step>
    <step num="11">Layer another 2 rotations of gold potatoes. </step>
    <step num="12">Sprinkle the chives in an even layer across the potatoes. </step>
    <step num="13">Layer another 2 rotations of gold potatoes. </step>
    <step num="14">Fan out the rest of the cheddar slices in a circular pattern on top of the potatoes. </step>
    <step num="15">Layer another 2 rotations of gold potatoes. </step>
    <step num="16">Place the circle of puff pastry on top, pressing it lightly into the potatoes. </step>
    <step num="17">Bake, uncovered, for 1 hour and 30 minutes. If the pastry or the edges of potatoes near the top are starting to get too dark, cover the dish with foil and continue baking. </step>
    <step num="18">Cool until the bottom of the dish is no longer warm. </step>
    <step num="19">While the potatoes bake, prepare the garlic cream sauce by transferring the cream from the soaked potatoes into a medium saucepan or pot. </step>
    <step num="20">Add the onion powder, garlic powder, and Parmesan, stirring while bringing to a boil. Set aside and reheat when serving. </step>
    <step num="21">Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="22">Run a knife along the sides of the bowl to make sure the potatoes are release, then invert it onto a baking tray. </step>
    <step num="23">Bake for another 10 minutes or so, until the slices start to turn golden brown and slightly crispy. </step>
    <step num="24">Transfer the dome to a cutting board, then slice into wedges. </step>
    <step num="25">Serve with the cream sauce, a sprinkle of chives. </step>
    <step num="26">Enjoy! </step>
