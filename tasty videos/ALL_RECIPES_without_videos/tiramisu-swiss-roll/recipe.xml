  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, combine the eggs, vanilla cake mix, vegetable oil, and water. Beat with an electric hand mixer to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">Pour the cake batter onto the prepared baking sheet and spread with a spatula into an even layer. </step>
    <step num="3">Bake for 8 minutes, or until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="4">Sift the cocoa powder through a fine-mesh sieve all over a clean kitchen towel. </step>
    <step num="5">Flip the cake onto the cocoa powder-dusted towel and remove the parchment paper. Starting with a short end, roll up the cake with the towel. </step>
    <step num="6">Refrigerate for 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="7">In a medium bowl, whip the heavy cream and espresso powder with an electric hand mixer until fluffy. </step>
    <step num="8">Add the mascarpone, sugar, and vanilla to the espresso cream and beat until smooth. </step>
    <step num="9">Unroll the cake and spread with the espresso cream in an even layer, leaving 1½ inches (4 cm) from the top empty and reserving 1 cup (225 g) of espresso cream for decoration. </step>
    <step num="10">Arrange the ladyfingers on the cake horizontally, 2 inches (5 cm) from the bottom. Brush the ladyfingers with the chilled espresso. </step>
    <step num="11">Roll the cake back up, using the towel as a guide but not rolling it inside the cake. </step>
    <step num="12">Refrigerate for another hour, then unwrap the cake. </step>
    <step num="13">Transfer the remaining espresso cream to a piping bag. </step>
    <step num="14">Pipe 6 espresso cream dollops on top of the tiramisu roll. Sprinkle chocolate shavings on top. </step>
    <step num="15">Slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="16">Enjoy! </step>
