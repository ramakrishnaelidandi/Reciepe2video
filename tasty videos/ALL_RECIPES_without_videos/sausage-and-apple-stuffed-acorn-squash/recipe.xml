  <steps>
    <step num="0">Using a sharp knife cut off the very top and bottom of each squash to create a flat base on each side (being careful not to cut through the center cavity). </step>
    <step num="1">Slice the squash in half, scrape out seeds to create individual bowls for the stuffing. </step>
    <step num="2">Drizzle each squash half with olive oil, salt, and pepper. </step>
    <step num="3">Roast in a preheated oven at 400˚F (200˚C) for 40-50 minutes - or until fork tender. </step>
    <step num="4">While squash is roasting - in a large fry pan over medium heat - heat oil and add Onion, Celery, Salt, Pepper, and Rosemary. Cook until onions begin to soften. </step>
    <step num="5">Add Garlic and Sausage, until sausage is browned on all sides. </step>
    <step num="6">Add Apple until slightly softened. Finally mix in Bread Crumbs and Parmesan cheese just until incorporated. Remove from heat. </step>
    <step num="7">Once Squash has finished roasting (when you can easily poke it with a fork) remove from oven and fill each with prepared stuffing mixture. </step>
    <step num="8">Return to Oven for 20 minutes - adding a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese to the top for the final 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
