    <step num="0">Lightly flour a clean work surface. Flour a rolling pin and roll out each puff pastry sheet to flatten the seams. Lay the sheets 2 by 2. </step>
    <step num="1">Make a diagonal cut across the 2 bottom sheets of puff pastry from the lower right corner to the midpoint on the left side of the lower left sheet. </step>
    <step num="2">Make another diagonal cut across the 2 top sheets of puff pastry from the upper right corner to the midpoint on the left side of the upper left sheet. </step>
    <step num="3">Holding the bottom pieces together, rotate clockwise 180˚ and up, so that the left side of the bottom strip meets the left side of the lower middle strip. </step>
    <step num="4">Holding the top pieces together, rotate counterclockwise 180˚ and down, so that the left side of the top strip meets the left side of the up middle strip. </step>
    <step num="5">Seal the seams by brushing a bit of egg wash where the pieces of pastry meet, overlapping the pieces slightly, and pressing together. </step>
    <step num="6">Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="7">Arrange the cheese slices in a single layer across the lower portion of the triangle. Top with a single layer of ham slices. </step>
    <step num="8">Roll up the puff pastry from the base of the triangle to the top point. </step>
    <step num="9">Place the croissant on the prepared baking sheet and cover with aluminum foil. </step>
    <step num="10">Bake for 45 minutes. </step>
    <step num="11">Remove the croissant from the oven, take off the foil, and brush the croissant with egg wash. </step>
    <step num="12">Bake for another 1 hour and 15 minutes, until the croissant is golden brown. </step>
