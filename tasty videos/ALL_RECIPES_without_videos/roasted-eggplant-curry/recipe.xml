  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). </step>
    <step num="1">Slice the tops off the eggplants, then slice them in half lengthwise. Cut each half once more lengthwise. Lay the slices on their flat sides and cut lengthwise into thirds. Finally, slice horizontally to form cubes. </step>
    <step num="2">Transfer to a baking sheet, drizzle with the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Bake for 25 minutes, stirring halfway through, until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large saucepan, heat the coconut oil over high hat. Add the onions, stir for 1 minute, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden brown, about 8 minutes. </step>
    <step num="4">Stir in the chili powder, cardamom, and smoked paprika. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. </step>
    <step num="5">Stir in the ground coriander, ½ teaspoon of black pepper, turmeric, garlic, and ginger. Cook for a few minutes more, stirring constantly. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the chopped tomatoes, coconut milk, water, and the roasted eggplant. </step>
