  <steps>
    <step num="0">Add the brown rice, vegetable broth, and diced carrots to your Instant Pot. Stir until combined. </step>
    <step num="1">Close the lid until you hear the beep. Tip: Closing the lid can be tricky. Have the pressure knob at 11 o’clock and turn right. </step>
    <step num="2">Turn pressure knob to “Sealing”. Select Manual and reduce the time to 24 minutes. It will say “On” in a few seconds. Note: the Instant Pot will need to warm up for 5-10 minutes. Steam will be released and a few minutes later, the time will start counting down. </step>
    <step num="3">Once the time goes off, carefully turn the pressure knob to “Venting”. Let all of the stream release before opening the lid. </step>
    <step num="4">Stir the rice, then transfer from the pot into a medium sized bowl and set aside. </step>
    <step num="5">Select “Saute” on the Instant Pot. Once it says “Hot”, add the oil. </step>
    <step num="6">When the oil is shimmering, add the onion. Cook for around 1 minute until slightly opaque. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the minced garlic, frozen peas, salt, and pepper. Mix until incorporated. </step>
    <step num="8">Add rice mixture and stir until everything is combined. </step>
    <step num="9">Make a well in the middle of the rice for the eggs. Pour the beaten eggs into the well, stirring only the eggs until they are cooked. </step>
    <step num="10">Mix everything together. Top with scallions. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
