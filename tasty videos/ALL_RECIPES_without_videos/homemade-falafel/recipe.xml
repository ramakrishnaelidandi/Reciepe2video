  <steps>
    <step num="0">To the bowl of a 2-quart food processor, add the chickpeas, onion, parsley, garlic, lemon juice, and spices. Pulse the ingredients together until just incorporated and they form a wet paste. Be careful not to overblend. </step>
    <step num="1">Transfer the chickpea mixture to a large bowl and add the bread crumbs, mixing until just incorporated. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours, or overnight. </step>
    <step num="2">Remove the chilled falafel mixture from the refrigerator and shape into 1-inch balls. The mixture should yield 18-20 balls. </step>
    <step num="3">In a large frying pan with high sides, heat about 1 inch of oil to 350˚F (180˚C). Fry the falafel balls in batches of 6 for 3 minutes, flipping halfway. Once they are golden brown and crispy, transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt. </step>
    <step num="4">Serve the falafel as desired, either as a sandwich, salad topping, or over a bed of greens with a side of tahini sauce. </step>
    <step num="5">Enjoy! </step>
