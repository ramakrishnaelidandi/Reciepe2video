  <steps>
    <step num="0">Add ground beef, salt, and pepper to a large bowl. Combine until the meat is evenly seasoned. </step>
    <step num="1">Roll into 16 meatballs and set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Cut each cheddar cheese block into 8 cubes (totaling 16 cubes). </step>
    <step num="3">Press the cheddar cheese cube into the meatball and wrap the meat around it, completely covering the cheese. </step>
    <step num="4">Preheat a skillet on medium heat for 10 minutes. After preheated, carefully coat with a light layer of oil with a high smoke point (we used canola oil). </step>
    <step num="5">Add sliders to the pan, frying on the first side until the bottom is browned and crisp and the sides begin to brown (about 2-4 minutes, depending on the desired doneness). Flip and finish cooking on the other side. </step>
    <step num="6">Serve immediately on Hawaiian sweet rolls with your favorite burger garnishes. (We added Roma tomatoes, red onion, lettuce, and Sriracha mayo.) </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
