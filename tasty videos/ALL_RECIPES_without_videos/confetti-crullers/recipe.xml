  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large pot over medium heat, combine the butter, water, milk, sugar, and salt. Whisk until the butter is melted and the mixture is steaming, about 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="1">Quickly whisk the all-purpose and whole wheat flours and the baking powder into the hot milk mixture. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, for 5 more minutes. Remove the pot from heat and stir with a spatula to cool the dough. </step>
    <step num="2">When the dough is no longer hot to the touch, add the eggs one at a time, stirring to incorporate before adding the next. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the vanilla and sprinkles and stir to distribute evenly. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the dough to a piping bag or zip-top bag fitted with a large star tip. </step>
    <step num="5">On a parchment-lined baking sheet, pipe 4-inch (10-cm) circles of dough. Chill in the freezer until solid, about 20 minutes. </step>
    <step num="6">Meanwhile, make the glaze: In a large bowl, combine the powdered sugar, milk, vanilla, and cream cheese. Whisk until smooth and runny. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="7">Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="8">Carefully add the crullers to the hot oil. Fry about 3 at a time for 4-5 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden brown. The fried crullers should feel much lighter than they were originally. Transfer the fried crullers to a wire rack set over a baking sheet. </step>
    <step num="9">While still warm, dip one side of the crullers in the glaze. Return to the wire rack and allow excess glaze to drip off. Top with sprinkles. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
