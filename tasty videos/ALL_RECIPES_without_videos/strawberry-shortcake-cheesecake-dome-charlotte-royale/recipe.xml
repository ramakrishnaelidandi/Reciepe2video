  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Whisk together eggs, ¾ cups (150 g) sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla until pale and fluffy. </step>
    <step num="2">Into the mixture sift in flour, baking powder &amp; salt. Mix until just combined. </step>
    <step num="3">Pour the sponge cake batter onto a 10x15-inch (25x38 cm) baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 10-12 minutes. Allow to cool. </step>
    <step num="4">In a mixing bowl beat together cream cheese, ½ cup sugar (100 g) and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Add in heavy cream and beat until light and fluffy. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="5">Cutting widthways, cut the cooled cake into 4 equal rectangles. </step>
    <step num="6">Spread the jam onto 2 rectangles. Then place the two rectangles together and top with a rectangle without any jam. </step>
    <step num="7">Transfer the stack of cake with jam onto a cutting board. Cut in half longways. Then cut widthways into 1 cm (½ inch) thick slices. The cut pieces of cake should be about square in shape. </step>
    <step num="8">Arrange the sliced pieces on cake into a medium sized bowl lined with cling film. Alternate the direction the lines are facing to create a checkered like pattern. As you reach the edges of the bowl, you may need to cut the pieces to fit. </step>
    <step num="9">Fill the cake with the cheesecake filling. Spreading evenly. </step>
    <step num="10">Arrange the strawberries on top making sure they slightly overlap each other. </step>
    <step num="11">Cover the cake with slices of the 4th piece of cake. Wrap the exposed cake with cling film and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. </step>
    <step num="12">To serve, unwrap the bottom layer of the cake, and place a plate on top. Flip the plate and carefully remove the bowl, and the remaining cling film. </step>
    <step num="13">Slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
