  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven for 375˚F/190˚C. </step>
    <step num="1">Slice the eggplants, roma tomatoes, squash, and zucchini into approximately ¹⁄₁₆-inch/1 ½-mm rounds, then set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">Heat olive oil in a 12-inch/30-cm oven safe pan over medium-high heat. Sauté onions, garlic, and bell peppers until soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add crushed tomatoes. Stir until ingredients are fully incorporated. Remove from heat, then add basil. Stir once more, then smooth the surface of the sauce with your spatula. </step>
    <step num="3">Arrange the sliced veggies in alternating patterns, (e.g. eggplant, tomato, squash, zucchini) on top of the sauce from the outer edge to the inside of the pan. Season with salt and pepper. </step>
    <step num="4">Mix herb seasoning and pour over the vegetables. </step>
    <step num="5">Cover the pan with tin foil and bake for 40 minutes. After 40 minutes, uncover, then bake for an additional 20 minutes. The vegetables should be soft. </step>
    <step num="6">Serve while hot as a main dish, or as a side dish. The ratatouille is also excellent the next day. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
