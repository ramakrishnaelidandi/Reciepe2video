  <steps>
    <step num="0">Make the crust: In a food processor, blend the oats into a coarse powder. </step>
    <step num="1">Add the butter to a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook until nutty brown in color, 5-6 minutes. Once the butter has browned, add the ground oats, flour, salt, and water, and mix to combine. Let cool for 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Transfer the crust mixture to a 9-inch (20 cm) tart pan, spreading evenly across the bottom and up the sides. Chill for 30 minutes. </step>
    <step num="3">Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C). </step>
    <step num="4">Make the filling: Place the apples in a large microwave-safe bowl and squeeze the lemon juice over, then toss to coat. Microwave for 4 minutes. Cover with a plate and let steam for 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Season the apples with the cinnamon and nutmeg, and toss to coat. </step>
    <step num="6">Spread the applesauce over the bottom of the crust. </step>
    <step num="7">Starting from the outside and working inward, arrange the apples in the pan in a circular pattern with the curved side up. Begin with the larger slices, overlapping slightly, and continue until the entire crust is filled. Brush the apples with the melted butter. </step>
    <step num="8">Bake for 1 hour, checking occasionally. If the edges are browning too quickly, cover gently with foil to prevent further browning as the tart cooks through. </step>
    <step num="9">If using, microwave the apricot jam for 20-30 seconds to melt. Use a pastry brush to paint the apricot jam over the warm tart for a nice, shiny finish. </step>
    <step num="10">Let the tart cool to room temperature before slicing and serving. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
