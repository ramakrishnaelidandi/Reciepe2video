    <step num="0">Melt the butter in a 5qt-pot over medium heat. </step>
    <step num="1">Add chili, and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the crushed garlic and ginger and cook for 2-3 minutes, until fragrant. Stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the onion is completely softened, about 10 minutes. Stir occasionally to make sure bottom doesn’t burn. </step>
