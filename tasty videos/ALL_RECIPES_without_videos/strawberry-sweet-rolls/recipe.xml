  <steps>
    <step num="0">Generously grease a 9-inch (23 cm) cast iron or cake pan. </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, whisk together warm milk, melted butter, and granulated sugar. The mixture should be just warm, registering between 100-110˚F (40˚C). If hotter, allow to cool slightly. </step>
    <step num="2">Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the warm mixture and let sit for 1 minute. </step>
    <step num="3">Add 4 cups (500 grams) of all-purpose flour to the milk mixture and mix with a wooden spoon until just combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Cover the bowl with a towel or plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise for 1 hour. </step>
    <step num="5">Preheat oven to 325˚F (160˚C). </step>
    <step num="6">After 1 hour, the dough should have nearly doubled in size. Remove the towel and add an additional ¾ cup (95 grams) of flour, the baking powder, and salt. Stir well, then turn out onto a well-floured surface. </step>
    <step num="7">Knead the dough lightly, adding additional flour as necessary, about ½ cup (60 grams), until the dough just loses its stickiness and does not stick to the surface. </step>
    <step num="8">Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about ½-inch (12 mm) thick. </step>
    <step num="9">In a small bowl combine the strawberry preserves and butter, stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="10">Spread the filling mixture evenly over the rolled out dough, leave about 1½ inches (4 cm) from the edge. </step>
    <step num="11">Starting from the bottom roll the dough upward, being careful not to squeeze the filling out. </step>
    <step num="12">With a knife cut the rolled dough into 8 pieces. </step>
    <step num="13">Place strawberry roll in the prepared cast iron or cake pan and cover with plastic wrap. Place in a warm spot and leave to rise for 30 minutes. The strawberry rolls should expand to the edges of the pan during this time. </step>
    <step num="14">Bake for 45 minutes. Cover the rolls with foil to prevent the outside from burning, and bake for an additional 35 minutes. </step>
    <step num="15">While the strawberry rolls are baking, prepare the frosting. In a medium-size mixing bowl, whisk together cream cheese, butter, vanilla, whole milk, and powdered sugar, until smooth. </step>
    <step num="16">Remove the strawberry rolls from the oven and let cool in the pan for at least 20 minutes. Once cool, drizzle frosting over the rolls before serving. </step>
    <step num="17">Enjoy! </step>
