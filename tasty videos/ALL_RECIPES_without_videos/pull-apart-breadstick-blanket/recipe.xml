  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">On a cutting board, divide the dough into 10 equal balls. </step>
    <step num="2">Begin rolling a ball of dough into a 6-inch (15-cm) tube and flatten until the strip of dough is about ⅛-inch (⅓-cm)thick. Place 5 pieces of string cheese on the strip of dough, spacing about ½ an inch ( 1 ¼-cm) apart. Pull up the dough to wrap around the pieces of mozzarella and seal together. Roll the cheese-stuffed tube of dough to close any remaining holes in the dough. Repeat with the dough and cheese. </step>
    <step num="3">On a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, arrange 5 of the tubes of dough horizontally. Weave in the remaining tubes of dough vertically between the horizontal tubes. </step>
    <step num="4">In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, garlic powder, and Parmesan. Brush the mixture all over the dough. </step>
    <step num="5">Bake for 30 minutes, until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="6">Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately, with marinara sauce for dipping. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
