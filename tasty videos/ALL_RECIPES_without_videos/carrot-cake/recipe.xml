  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Grease 3 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pans and line with parchment paper. </step>
    <step num="1">Grate the carrots on the small holes of a box grater. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large bowl, sift together 2½ cups (310 G) of flour, the cinnamon, allspice, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Whisk together. </step>
    <step num="3">In a separate large bowl, beat the brown sugar, granulated sugar, and eggs together with an electric hand mixer on medium speed until just combined. </step>
    <step num="4">With the mixer running, gradually pour in the vegetable oil. </step>
    <step num="5">With the mixer on medium-low speed, add ⅓ of the flour mixture at a time to the wet ingredients. Beat just to incorporate. Stop mixing when there is just a small amount of flour visible. </step>
    <step num="6">In a small bowl, toss the raisins with the remaining tablespoon of flour. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the raisin, grated carrots, and pineapple to the batter and fold to incorporate with a rubber spatula. </step>
    <step num="8">Divide the cake batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the tops. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 25-30 minutes, until a fork inserted in the center of a cake comes out clean. </step>
    <step num="10">Cool the cakes on a wire rack until the pans are cool to the touch. Remove the cakes from the pans and let cool completely on the rack. </step>
    <step num="11">Make the icing: In a large bowl, beat together the butter, cream cheese, and vanilla with an electric hand mixer on medium-low speed. Once combined, mix on medium-high speed for 30 seconds, until light and fluffy. </step>
    <step num="12">Add the powdered sugar, ½ cup (60 G) at a time, beating on medium-low speed to incorporate each addition. </step>
    <step num="13">Assemble the cake: Check to see if the top of each cake is flat. If not, use a serrated knife level off the cakes. </step>
    <step num="14">Place 1 cake layer on a serving platter or cake stand. Spoon ¼ of the icing on top and spread in an even layer. Add another layer of cake and spread with another ¼ of the icing. Set the last cake layer on top with the bottom up to ensure a very flat surface. Spread the rest of the icing over the top and sides. </step>
    <step num="15">Gently press the walnuts into the icing around the sides of the cake. </step>
    <step num="16">Chill for 30-60 minutes to let the icing set, then slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="17">Enjoy! </step>
