  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Using a coarse grater, grate the cauliflower until the entire head has crumbled down into small bit. </step>
    <step num="2">Transfer the cauliflower bits to a bowl and sprinkle over a ½ teaspoon of the salt. Mix the cauliflower to incorporate the salt and let sit for 20 minutes to draw out moisture. </step>
    <step num="3">Transfer the soaking cauliflower to another bowl lined with a large towel. Wrap the towel closed and squeeze so that all of the excess liquid is strained. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the cauliflower back into the first bowl used and mix with the cheese, chives, garlic, olive oil, basil, black pepper, eggs and remaining ½ teaspoon of salt. </step>
    <step num="5">Turnover a large roasting tray and line with parchment paper - this helps prevent burning on the bottom of the hash browns. Divide the cauliflower mixture into 6 even portions, place on the tray, and shape into hash browns. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 35-40 minutes, until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="7">Let the hash browns cool for about 15 minutes until they have set. </step>
    <step num="8">Serve with desired dipping sauce. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
