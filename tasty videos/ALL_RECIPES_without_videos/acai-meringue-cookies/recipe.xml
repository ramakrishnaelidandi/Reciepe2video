  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a saucepan, boil ½ cup (100 g) sugar, water, and acai puree. </step>
    <step num="1">Reduce heat to simmer and cook until mixture thickens into a syrup. Add lemon when thickening. </step>
    <step num="2">Let cool before using. </step>
    <step num="3">Preheat oven to 225˚F (105˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">In a bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until they are foamy. </step>
    <step num="5">Add salt and lemon juice. Continue whisking. </step>
    <step num="6">Slowly add sugar while whisking and beat until glossy, stiff peaks form. </step>
    <step num="7">Spoon meringue mixture on the parchment sheet and smooth the top of the meringue with the back of the spoon. </step>
    <step num="8">Drizzle about ¼ teaspoon of acai syrup on the meringue and swirl with a toothpick. Repeat for each cookie. </step>
    <step num="9">Bake for 90 minutes, until the outside shell becomes stiff and the meringue has gone from shiny to matte. The cookie should easily lift off the parchment. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
