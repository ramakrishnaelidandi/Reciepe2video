  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Roll out a circle of pie dough and cut in half. Press the dough into two small tart tins, and remove any excess dough. Use a fork to prick the base of the pie dough. </step>
    <step num="2">Bake in the oven for 20 minutes at 425˚F (220˚C), or until the tart is golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool completely. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and whisk to combine. </step>
    <step num="4">Pour in milk and egg yolks and whisk, until the mixture just barely comes to a boil and becomes thick like pudding, about 6-8 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">Stir in the butter and vanilla, and remove the saucepan from the heat. </step>
    <step num="6">In three separate microwave-safe bowls, melt each of the chocolates by microwaving for intervals of 15 seconds, stirring until smooth. </step>
    <step num="7">Pour the pudding into each of the separate bowls of melted chocolate. Stir until they are well combined and silky. </step>
    <step num="8">Spoon many small dollops of each chocolate pudding into the pie crust. Make any design you would like with a toothpick. Chill in the fridge for 2 hours, until set. </step>
    <step num="9">Garnish with fresh fruit, or mint </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
