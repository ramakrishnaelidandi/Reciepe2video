  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Add the egg whites and vanilla extract to a medium bowl and use a whisk or hand mixer to beat until frothy, about 1 minute. </step>
    <step num="2">Sift in the flour, sugar, and salt through a fine-mesh sieve. </step>
    <step num="3">Using a spatula, gently incorporate into the batter until paste-like. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the batter is smooth and falls into ribbons when the spatula is picked up. </step>
    <step num="5">Place 1 tablespoon of batter onto a silpat-lined baking sheet and spread into a 3-inch (7-cm) circle. </step>
    <step num="6">Repeat with another tablespoon of batter, making sure to only leave two circles on the silpat. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 8 minutes, until the edges become golden brown. </step>
    <step num="8">Working quickly, use a spatula to remove the cookies from the pan. Add a fortune in the middle, fold the cookies in half, then place the flat side on the lip of a cup, folding the edges down into a fortune cookie shape. Place the folded fortune cookies in a mini muffin tin until cooled to retain their shape. </step>
    <step num="9">Repeat with remaining batter. </step>
    <step num="10">Enjoy! </step>
