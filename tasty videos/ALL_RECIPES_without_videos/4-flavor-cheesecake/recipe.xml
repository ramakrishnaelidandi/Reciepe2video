  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a large bowl, mix together the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter until combined. </step>
    <step num="1">Pour the crust mixture into a 9-inch (23 cm) springform cake pan. Press crumbs down firmly with the bottom of a small ramekin or glass to form an even base. </step>
    <step num="2">Carefully break the remaining graham crackers in half, so that you have 8 squares. </step>
    <step num="3">Push the graham crackers into the crust with the split line facing upwards to form an X shape, dividing the crust into four equal sections. </step>
    <step num="4">Press down on the crust one more time to ensure the graham crackers are secure. Cover and chill in the freezer for at least 10 minutes while preparing the fillings. </step>
    <step num="5">In a small bowl, dissolve the gelatin in the water. Set aside to bloom. </step>
    <step num="6">In a large bowl, beat together the cream cheese and sugar until smooth. </step>
    <step num="7">Add 2½ cups (720 ml) whipping cream and beat until the batter is light and fluffy. </step>
    <step num="8">Warm the gelatin in the microwave for about 15 seconds so that it’s fluid, and incorporate into the batter. </step>
    <step num="9">Divide the cheesecake batter evenly between 4 medium bowls. </step>
    <step num="10">In the first bowl, whisk in the vanilla extract and remaining whipping cream. </step>
    <step num="11">In the second bowl, whisk in ⅓ cup (80 grams) lemon curd. </step>
    <step num="12">In the third bowl, whisk in the dulce de leche. </step>
    <step num="13">In the fourth bowl, whisk in the chocolate hazelnut spread. </step>
    <step num="14">To assemble the cheesecake, slowly pour the contents of bowl #1 into a quarter of the pan. Repeat with remaining flavors. Use a spatula to smooth the tops. </step>
    <step num="15">Carefully dollop the raspberry jam in small circles on top of the vanilla cheesecake. Use a toothpick or knife to carefully swirl it into the filling. Garnish the outer border with fresh raspberries. </step>
    <step num="16">Garnish the outer border of the chocolate hazelnut cheesecake with the chocolate hazelnut truffles. </step>
    <step num="17">Garnish the outer border of the dulce de leche cheesecake with the chopped pecans and drizzle with dulce de leche </step>
    <step num="18">Pour the remaining lemon curd on top of the lemon cheesecake and smooth with an offset spatula or spoon. Garnish the outer border with candied lemon slices. </step>
    <step num="19">Cover the top of the pan tightly with plastic wrap and chill for 4 hours or overnight in the fridge before slicing and serving. </step>
    <step num="20">Enjoy! </step>
