    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large bowl, evenly season chicken thighs with salt, pepper, paprika, and parsley. </step>
    <step num="2">On high, heat olive oil in a oven-proof pot and place chicken thighs, skin-side down, in the hot oil. Cook 5-6 minutes or the thighs develop brown crispy skin and flip over. </step>

    <step num="4">Add the garlic and onions to the pot, and cook until the onions are transparent. </step>
    <step num="5">Pour in the rice and chicken broth to the pot and season with salt and pepper. Stir well, bringing to a boil. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the chicken thighs back into the pot, skin-side up, on top of the rice, bring back to a boil and cover with a lid. </step>
    <step num="7">Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked. </step>
    <step num="8">NOTE: For a crispy skin, remove chicken thighs and broil. </step>
    <step num="9">Enjoy! </step>
