  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">Make the banana custard: In a large bowl, mash the bananas. Add the eggs, milk, and heavy cream and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="2">In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla and mix with a fork. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the sugar mixture to the custard mixture and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="4">Add the cubed bread, chocolate chips, and pecans to the custard mixture and toss well to coat. Let soak for 10 minutes. </step>
    <step num="5">While the bread is soaking, make the caramel base: In a medium microwave-safe bowl, microwave the butter for about 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds, until melted and hot. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the brown sugar and stir to combine. Microwave for another minute, stirring halfway, until the sugar is mostly dissolved. </step>
    <step num="7">Add the salt, vanilla, and pecans and stir to combine. </step>
    <step num="8">Pour the caramel into the bottom of a 9 (22 cm) x 13-inch (33 cm) baking dish and spread evenly. Arrange the bananas, cut side down, over the caramel. </step>
    <step num="9">Spoon the brioche-custard mixture evenly over the bananas. </step>
    <step num="10">Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes, then uncover and bake for 40-45 minutes longer, until the custard is set. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="11">Run a knife around the edges of the baking dish to loosen the bake, then invert onto a rectangular serving dish. Do not wait any longer than 5 minutes or the bake will stick to the pan. </step>
    <step num="12">Slice and serve. </step>
    <step num="13">Enjoy! </step>
