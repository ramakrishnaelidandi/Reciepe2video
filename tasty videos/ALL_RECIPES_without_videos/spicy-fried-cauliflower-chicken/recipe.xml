  <steps>
    <step num="0">In a medium bowl, combine the flour, arrowroot powder, salt, cayenne, white pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, Old Bay seasoning, and nutritional yeast. </step>
    <step num="1">In another medium bowl, combine the hot sauce, soy milk, and Dijon mustard and whisk until creamy. </step>
    <step num="2">In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat the oil to 350°F (180°C). Double-line a large plate with paper towels and keep nearby. </step>
    <step num="3">Use one hand to dip a cauliflower floret into the wet mixture, then drop it into the flour mixture. Use your dry hand to coat it completely. Dip it back into the wet mixture and again in the dry mixture, keeping one hand devoted to wet and one to dry. </step>
    <step num="4">Carefully lower the twice-coated floret into the hot oil. Repeat with the remaining cauliflower until you can’t fit any more into the pot. Do not overcrowd. Fry for 4-5 minutes, until the pieces are golden. Transfer the fried cauliflower to the lined plate and continue to fry the remaining cauliflower. Serve hot. </step>
    <step num="5">Enjoy! </step>
