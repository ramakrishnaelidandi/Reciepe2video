    <step num="0">Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). </step>
    <step num="1">In a large skillet, heat the oil and cook onions and garlic for 3 minutes, or until they start to soften. Add the ground turkey to the pan, followed by salt, pepper, and oregano. Stir and cook for 3-4 minutes. </step>
    <step num="2">Then add zucchini and diced tomatoes. Cook until zucchini has begun to soften and remove from heat. </step>
    <step num="3">Cut the top off of the bell pepper low enough that the stem remains attached and remove the seeds. Save the top! </step>
    <step num="4">Carefully, carve out your desired jack-o’-lantern face using a steak knife or paring knife. Repeat for the rest of the bell peppers. </step>
    <step num="5">Place carved bell peppers in a baking dish and spoon in a layer of cooked rice in the bottom followed by the turkey mixture, and top with mozzarella cheese. Put the top of the bell pepper back on top. </step>
    <step num="6">Bake for 35 minutes or until peppers are tender and the cheese has melted. </step>
    <step num="7">Enjoy! </step>
