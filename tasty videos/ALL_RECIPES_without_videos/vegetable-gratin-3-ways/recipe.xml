  <steps>
    <step num="0">Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). </step>
    <step num="1">Make the béchamel sauce: Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and sauté for 3 minutes, or until fragrant. </step>
    <step num="2">Add the flour and whisk into the butter. Cook for 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. </step>
    <step num="3">While whisking, pour in the milk and heavy cream. Season with the salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, whisking frequently, until the sauce coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. </step>
    <step num="4">Remove the leaves and stem from the head of the cauliflower and chop into roughly ½-inch (1-cm) florets. Set aside. </step>
    <step num="5">Trim the Brussels sprouts, then thinly slice. Add the sprouts to a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking dish and push to one side, filling about a third of the dish. </step>
    <step num="6">Add the corn to the center third of the baking dish. Add the cauliflower florets to the remaining third of the baking dish. </step>
    <step num="7">Pour the béchamel sauce evenly over the vegetables. </step>
    <step num="8">Top the Brussels sprouts with the Gruyère cheese and bacon bits. </step>
    <step num="9">Top the corn with the cheddar cheese. </step>
    <step num="10">Top the cauliflower with the Parmesan cheese. </step>
    <step num="11">Sprinkle the bread crumbs evenly over the vegetables. </step>
    <step num="12">Cover the dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes, then uncover and bake for 30 minutes more, until the vegetables are tender and the top is golden brown. </step>
    <step num="13">Serve warm. </step>
    <step num="14">Enjoy! </step>
