  <steps>
    <step num="0">Grease a baking sheet with nonstick spray. </step>
    <step num="1">In a medium pot over high heat, add the milk and vegetable broth and bring to a boil. </step>
    <step num="2">Whisk in the polenta and reduce the heat to low, whisking continuously for about 5 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed and the polenta is creamy. </step>
    <step num="3">Add the butter, salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, and rosemary and stir until well-combined. </step>
    <step num="4">Transfer the polenta to the prepared baking sheet and spread out evenly with a spatula. Chill for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days to set. </step>
    <step num="5">If baking, preheat the oven to 425ºF (220ºC). </step>
    <step num="6">Make the aioli: Combine the mayonnaise, garlic, parsley, and lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and mix until well-combined. Chill until ready to use. </step>
    <step num="7">Carefully flip the baking sheet onto a cutting board to release the polenta. Slice in half lengthwise, and then cut into 22 equal-sized fries, each about 4 inches (10 cm) long and 1 inch (2 ½ cm) wide. </step>
    <step num="8">If baking, use a spatula to transfer the fries onto wire racks set over 2 baking sheets. Brush each fry generously with olive oil. Bake for 30 minutes, flipping halfway through and brushing with more oil, until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="9">If frying, heat the canola oil in a large pot until it reaches 375ºF (190ºC). Using a large spider, submerge 2 fries at a time into the oil and fry for 2-4 minutes, until golden brown and crispy. Remove from the oil and transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to cool for at least 5 minutes. </step>
    <step num="10">Serve the fries with aioli. </step>
    <step num="11">Enjoy! </step>
