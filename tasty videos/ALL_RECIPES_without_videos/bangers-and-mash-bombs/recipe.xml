  <steps>
    <step num="0">NOTE: To make a brown onion, try adding ½ teaspoon of mixed herbs while cooking. </step>
    <step num="1">Mash together the potatoes, salt, pepper, cheese, butter, and onion. </step>
    <step num="2">Cut the sausages in half and surround them with a thin layer of mashed potato. </step>
    <step num="3">Lay out 3 bowls, each one containing a different coating: flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs. </step>
    <step num="4">Coat the croquette first in flour, then eggs, followed by breadcrumbs, then one more time in the eggs, and lastly breadcrumbs. </step>
    <step num="5">Heat the oil to 160°C (325˚F). </step>
    <step num="6">NOTE: If you don’t have a thermometer, you can test the oil by dropping in a small piece of white bread. If it sizzles and browns within 45 seconds, the oil is ready. </step>
    <step num="7">Carefully deep-fry the bangers and mash bombs in small batches for a few minutes until golden brown. </step>
    <step num="8">Drain on a paper towel, sprinkle with salt, and serve with warm gravy. </step>
